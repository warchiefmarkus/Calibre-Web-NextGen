"""Helpers for Calibre-style hierarchical custom columns ("dot notation").

Values such as ``Computers.DB.Oracle`` stored in tag-like custom columns are
converted into nested tree dictionaries so they can be rendered as collapsible
trees, and a node matches itself plus all of its descendants.

This module intentionally has no Flask/SQLAlchemy dependencies so it stays
unit-testable in isolation.
