"""What every sign-in path does with the rate limiter.

The application limiter runs with ``auto_check=False``, so each view counts
its own request (``pace``) and clears its buckets once the sign-in succeeds
(``clear_current_limits``). Clients that send HTTP Basic credentials with
every request are paced by ``BasicAuthPacing`` instead. An administrator can
point the limiter at an external store; when that store is down, these calls
log and let the request through, so an outage cannot lock every reader and
device out, and a sign-in that already succeeded is never turned into an
error by its clean-up.

Callers pass their own module's ``limiter`` so a test that replaces it there
still governs the call.

    """Sign-in pacing for clients that send HTTP Basic credentials every time.

    KOReader sync and OPDS readers send the account and password with every
    request, so a device still holding an old password repeats the same wrong
    one on every sync, and such a device often shares its address with the
    owner's other devices behind one household router. Pacing each request
    would let it lock the owner out. Instead:

    - a bucket is kept per client address and account, and
    - only a *new* wrong password counts against it: repeating one already
      refused this minute is no guess, so a stale device fills nothing, while
      someone trying passwords fills it after ``SIGN_IN_ATTEMPTS``;
    - a full bucket refuses the request before its password is checked, so a
      right guess is refused too until the minute is out;
    - an app password is checked before the bucket: it is a random token no
      one can guess, so devices using one are never refused;
    - a right password clears the bucket;
    - a wrong password this client already sent this minute is answered
      without checking it again, so a stale device costs neither a password
      hash nor a directory bind (a failed bind a directory may count towards
      locking the account) on every sync.

    When the limiter's store stops answering, pacing carries on in memory,
    as the limiter's own checks do. It lets requests through only when the
    limiter is off, not yet set up, or memory fails too: an outage must not
    lock readers out.
