"""Trailing-slash policy for hand-typed URLs.

Werkzeug treats ``/kosync`` and ``/kosync/`` as two different resources.
A rule declared *with* a trailing slash redirects when you ask for it
without one, but a rule declared *without* one — which is nearly every
route in this app — simply 404s when you ask for it with one. Users type
and bookmark URLs with trailing slashes, so pages that work when reached
through a link 404 when reached from the address bar (fork #628: KOReader
setup at ``/kosync/`` 404s, ``/kosync`` works).

Rather than hand-annotating hundreds of routes — the app already carries
one ad-hoc patch of this shape, ``/app`` plus ``/app/`` in the SPA
blueprint — the policy lives in one place and is applied when routing has
already failed. Nothing that resolves today changes behaviour; the only
requests affected are ones that currently return 404.
