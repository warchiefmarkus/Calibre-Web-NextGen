"""The ORDER BY behind every book list, in one place.

Two things made this a shared module rather than a constant in each caller.

**Ties.** Every list here pages with LIMIT/OFFSET — ``fill_indexpage``,
``get_search_results``, the ``/api/v1`` lists. When the leading columns of an
ORDER BY tie, SQLite orders the tied rows however its plan happens to walk
them, and that is not a promise it keeps: measured on a table of twenty books
sharing one timestamp, "Newest" returned them oldest-first because the plan
scanned the rowid, then returned them newest-first once an index on the sort
column existed. So the user sees a list that is sorted, then is not (fork
#1331). Ties are the normal case, not an edge one: a bulk ingest gives every
book in the run one timestamp, calibre writes ``0101-01-01`` for a book with no
publication date, and every book outside a series carries series_index 1.0.

Each order therefore ends on a unique column, running the same way as the sort
the user asked for, so the order is total and the pages line up.

**One copy.** The classic UI and the new UI's API each carried their own map of
the same sorts, and both were missing the same tiebreakers. A sort fixed in one
would have stayed broken in the other.

``hotdesc``/``hotasc`` are the exception to ``Books.id``: those run against the
app database, grouped on ``Downloads.book_id``, where ``Books`` is not in
scope. The group key is unique per row of that result, so it is the tiebreaker
there.

**Per-user orders.** ``recent`` is not in the map, because the map is built once
at import time and this order needs the viewer's id. ``book_sort_order`` builds
it per request instead; the callers that iterate the map (the #1331 invariants,
``custom_column_sort``'s magic-shelf allowlist) therefore never see a sort whose
meaning depends on who is asking. See ``recent_sort_order``.

    One SQL expression, evaluated per row of whatever list is being paged, so
    the endpoint keeps paginating in SQL. Three correlated aggregates, one per
    carrier the readers actually write:

    * ``book_read_link`` — the read tri-state and its clocks. Written by
      ``kosync.update_book_read_status`` (KOReader sync, and the web reader,
      which reuses it), by ``kobo.HandleStateRequest``'s StatusInfo branch and
      by ``helper.edit_book_read_status`` (the Read checkmark).
    * ``kobo_bookmark`` — the cross-device position, advanced by
      ``device_reading_position.advance_kobo_bookmark`` for a Kobo state PUT, a
      KOReader sync and a web-reader save alike.
    * ``bookmark`` — the web reader's own epub.js CFI, stamped on every save
      including the ones that carry no percentage (``cps/api/reader.py``).

    Each is gated on POSITIVE evidence rather than on the row existing, because
    ``kobo.HandleStateRequest`` seeds the entire ReadBook/KoboReadingState/
    KoboBookmark/KoboStatistics graph — with fresh clocks and no progress — on a
    **GET**. Ungated, a Kobo that merely listed the library would reorder it.
    ``helper.reset_reading_position`` ("mark unread") clears exactly what these
    gates read, so a restarted book leaves the read group.

    ``kosync_progress`` is deliberately not a fourth carrier: it is keyed by
    file checksum in app.db while the checksums live in metadata.db, and its PUT
    handler already mirrors every matched book into the two carriers above.
