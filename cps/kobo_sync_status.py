    For every (user_id, book_id) pair in kobo_synced_books with this

    them so each device cursor moves beyond the tombstone. Without this,
    the device retains the book locally forever — calibre absence is
    not interpreted as deletion, only tombstones are.

    The UUID retained at delivery wins whenever it is present, even if the
    caller also supplies one: it is what that user's device was actually told
    the book was, and the caller's value is only a fallback for rows written
    before UUID retention existed. If both are empty the row is a no-op.

    drops those collections. Runs when "sync only selected shelves to Kobo"
    goes off -> on (classic ``/me`` form and ``POST /api/v1/account/profile``).

    Book-level reconciliation is deliberately NOT done here. ``HandleSyncRequest``
    (cps/kobo.py) already computes exactly this difference — synced books minus
    the books the user's kobo_sync manual and magic shelves make eligible, with
    the #468 fail-safe for unreliable magic membership — and it does the part
    that matters: it emits a ``ChangedEntitlement`` with ``archived=True`` so
    the DEVICE removes the book, and only then drops the tracking row.

    Fork #866/#1008: doing it here as well was worse than redundant.

    * The old query joined ``Shelf`` on ``user_id`` alone, never on
      ``Shelf.id == BookShelf.shelf``, so any one ordinary shelf in the account
      paired with every synced book and matched ``kobo_sync == 0``. Books that
      WERE on the Kobo-sync shelf got swept. Reproduced live.
    * It deleted each book's ``KoboSyncedBooks`` row before any sync had run.
      That row is the sync handler's only input for the removal command, and a
      swept book is by definition outside the eligible set the handler queries,
      so the device was never told to drop it — the books stayed on the reader
      forever, which is the symptom @auspex reported.
    * It also wrote ``ArchivedBook`` rows, hiding those books from the user's
      own library in the web UI. Turning on a Kobo sync preference should not
      archive most of someone's library.

    Leaving the tracking rows intact is what makes "the extras get archived off
    on the next sync" actually true.
