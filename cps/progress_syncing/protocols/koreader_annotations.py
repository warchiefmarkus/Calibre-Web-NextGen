"""KOReader annotation bridge — device-agnostic pull/push API (Phase 2).

Two routes on the existing ``kosync`` blueprint, reusing its auth + book
resolution verbatim (no new credentials for users):

    GET /kosync/syncs/annotations/<document>  -> pull (server -> device)
    PUT /kosync/syncs/annotations             -> push (device -> server)

``<document>`` is the KOReader partial-MD5 digest, resolved to a calibre book
via ``get_book_by_checksum`` exactly as progress sync does, so annotations
converge on the same book across formats/checksums.

The wire shape is the portable annotation dict (see
``cps/services/annotation_portable.py``); the plugin's device provider maps it
to device-native fields (KoboReader.sqlite). Pull includes ``hidden`` rows so
the device can delete locally; push records ``device_origin_id`` to suppress
feedback loops and fans out to enabled sync targets (Hardcover).

Deletions are NAMED by the device (``deleted: [annotation_id, ...]``), never
inferred from what a push omits. #906 tried the inference — a push could declare
itself ``complete`` and the server reaped every live row it omitted — but these
two pushes are byte-identical on the wire:

    the user deleted their last highlight   (#905, must delete)
    this device never had those highlights  (#920, must not delete)

and the KOReader-native provider is push-only (``applyToDevice`` is a no-op off
Kobo), so a second device could never receive the first device's highlights yet
still declared its empty set complete — silently destroying them, permanently,
since ``apply_portable`` never un-hides a tombstone. Only the device can tell
the two apart, because only it knows what it used to have, so the decision lives
there and the server obeys. ``complete`` is still accepted and ignored.

The route handlers are thin; ``build_pull_payload`` + ``apply_push`` hold the
testable logic. See notes/2026-05-25-annotation-two-way-phase1-phase2-DESIGN.md §4.
