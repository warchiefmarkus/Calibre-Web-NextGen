KOReader Sync Server Implementation for Calibre-Web-Automated

This module provides a sync server compatible with KOReader's sync functionality,
allowing users to sync their reading progress across devices.

Protocol Specification:
    - Authentication: HTTP Basic Auth (RFC 7617)
    - Endpoints:
        * GET  /kosync/users/auth - Authenticate user
        * GET  /kosync/syncs/progress/<document> - Get reading progress
        * PUT  /kosync/syncs/progress - Update reading progress
        * GET  /kosync - Plugin download page
        * GET  /kosync/export - Bulk export of all progress (non-protocol)

Security:
    - All API endpoints use HTTP Basic Authentication
    - Document identifiers validated to prevent injection attacks
    - Session management via SQLAlchemy with proper isolation
    - Rate limiting should be applied at reverse proxy level

Integration:
    - Syncs with Calibre library via BookFormatChecksum table
    - Updates ReadBook status based on reading percentage thresholds
    - Maintains KoboReadingState for compatibility with Kobo sync
    - Atomic commits ensure sync data integrity

Based on the reference implementation from koreader-sync-server

#
# It has to be a sentinel rather than an empty/absent value because the column
# is NOT NULL and, more importantly, because of what the client does with it.
# ``CWNGSync:syncToProgress`` feeds this column straight to ``GotoXPointer`` for
# any non-numeric value, and ``applyProgressToBook`` writes it to
# ``last_xpointer``. The plugin's only guard is ``body.progress == nil``, and in
# Lua ``"" ~= nil`` — so an empty string would sail past it and store a
# meaningless xpointer on the device. The colon keeps it outside the space of
# things KOReader itself pushes and mirrors ``is_valid_key_field``'s reservation
# of ':' for internal use.

# position was there, and nothing named the parameter that would reveal it.
# This appears ONLY on that miss, never alongside a served position, so its
# presence means "ask for these and you get something".
#
# It is safe to add to a body an already-installed plugin will parse:
# ``SyncLogic.resolveRemotePosition`` reads ``progress``, ``position_kind`` and
# ``percentage``, none of which this adds, and no client counts the body's
# keys — so such a client still resolves this to "no progress", exactly as it
# resolves the bare ``{}`` it gets today.

    out, and #1445 is that those two were indistinguishable on the wire.

    The re-query runs on the miss path of a silent client only, and cannot
    return a locator row: the first lookup differs solely by excluding the

    Python's ``str.lower()`` is not enough. It also folds non-ASCII: U+212A

    code point and ASCII ``"k"`` as separate types, and ``str.lower()`` would
    collapse them onto one key and drop a value, with no ``ORDER BY`` deciding
    which survives.

    Not part of the KOReader protocol, it's meant to be a bulk read-only export
    to feed data into other services.
    Auth is handled as other KOSync endpoints: HTTP Basic, app passwords supported.

    Because this is not part of the protocol, percentage is exported as stored
    (0-100) instead of the 0-1 decimal that KOReader expects.

    Entry format:
        {
            "calibre_book_id": 42,  # Calibre book id
            "created_at": "...",    # From Kobo bookmark (reading started), may be null

            "identifiers": {...},   # {type: value} map, {} when none found
        }

    Author names are handed out in display form, with Calibre's escaped "|"
    turned back into the comma it stands for. Identifier values are verbatim;
    their type keys are ASCII-lowercased, which keeps two types the library
    stores separately from collapsing onto one key.

    Timestamps are UTC, ISO 8601 with explicit offset. Rows that don't resolve
    to a Calibre library book (checksum-keyed records that never converged after
    #633, or books since deleted) carry no identifiable metadata and are
    omitted from the export.
