    Comparing structured parts rather than raw strings is what keeps

    (`http://cwng.local@evil.example` -> host `evil.example`) resolve to the real
    host rather than the one it is dressed up as.

    The port is deliberately NOT compared. A reverse proxy very commonly forwards
    `X-Forwarded-Host: books.example.com` with the port stripped while the browser
    states `Origin: https://books.example.com:8443`; comparing ports would 403 every
    write for that entirely ordinary deployment. This does relax the check: the port is
    genuinely part of a browser's origin, so what is enforced here is deliberately
    "same host" rather than exact same-origin. The trade is worth it — an attacker who
    can serve content on another port of the operator's own hostname is already past a
    bigger boundary than this hook, while a port-stripping proxy is common enough that
    comparing ports would break real installs. (Ignoring the port also sidesteps `port or default` coercing an
    explicit `:0` to the scheme default.)

    """Reject a state-changing /api/v1 request that says it came from another site.

    The CSRF token is enforced separately by the global CSRFProtect middleware; this
    is the Origin layer underneath it (#1370). Flask-WTF's own referer check is
    disabled here (WTF_CSRF_SSL_STRICT=False in cps/__init__.py), so before this hook
    a request bearing a valid token plus `Origin: https://evil.example` was accepted
    and performed the write.

    Deliberately "verify only if stated": a browser cannot suppress Origin on a
    cross-site mutation, so this closes the browser CSRF vector in full, while curl
    and native clients that send no such header keep working — they carry no ambient
    credentials, so they were never the vector. `Origin: null` (sandboxed iframe) is
    a stated-but-unusable origin and is refused rather than waved through.

    Registered AFTER _require_api_auth on purpose. Flask runs blueprint before_request
    handlers in registration order until one returns non-None, and the auth gate
    returns None both for an authenticated caller and for _PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS — so this
    still covers a cross-site `POST /api/v1/auth/login` (login-CSRF) while an
    unauthenticated request to a protected route keeps the API's documented JSON 401
    instead of being answered 403. Running first would also have made the hook an
    oracle: varying Origin on an unauthenticated request would return 403 for an
    untrusted origin and 401 for a trusted one, disclosing which origins are trusted.

    Host comparison uses request.host_url, which ProxyFix has already rewritten from
    X-Forwarded-Host/Proto, so this holds behind a reverse proxy and on a subpath. The
    setup it cannot infer is a proxy that rewrites Host and forwards no
    X-Forwarded-Host (or sends only the standardised `Forwarded:` header, which
    neither ProxyFix nor ReverseProxied consumes) — there request.host_url is the
    internal name, and those operators name their public origin in
    CWNG_TRUSTED_ORIGINS. Erring towards accepting is deliberate: a false rejection
    breaks every write for a legitimate user and cannot be retracted once released,
    while the vector this closes is already covered by the CSRF token and a
    SameSite=Lax session cookie.
