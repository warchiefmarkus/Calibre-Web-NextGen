"""Stage 0 SPA API for Kobo two-way annotation sync preferences.

This module is deliberately a *preference* surface over a feature that is
still switched off. It reads and writes the user's opt-in
(``user.kobo_two_way_annotation_sync``), the user's scope
(``user.kobo_two_way_annotation_scope``: 'all' or 'selected'), and per-book
opt-out state (``KoboAnnotationBookState.authority_status='disabled'``). It
also READS observed per-book authority/opaque state so the SPA can show what
enabling will actually do.

It must never do more than that:

* it does NOT call ``gates_allow`` or anything in
  ``cps/services/annotation_sync`` / ``cps/readingservices.py``;
* it never names a book in ``checkforchanges`` and never serves an
  annotation GET;
* it never writes ``authority_status`` to anything but 'disabled' (user
  opt-out) or back to 'unseeded' (user re-enables; the book must re-seed and
  re-prove itself before any future sync — re-enabling never restores a
  previous authority);
* both feature gates keep their defaults; nothing here makes a book sync.

Scope semantics (see notes/KOBO-TWO-WAY-ANNOTATION-SYNC-DESIGN.md §9-10):

* 'all' (default) — every book syncs as it becomes ready, unless the user
  opted that book out ('disabled').
* 'selected' — only individually picked books sync. Entering 'selected'
  bulk-marks the user's 'unseeded' rows 'disabled' so nothing is picked
  implicitly: a legacy backfill row must never read as an explicit pick.
  Switching back to 'all' does not resurrect disabled books (an opt-out is
  user data, not ours to undo); each book can be re-enabled individually.
