"""Gevent-aware parallel fan-out for work that runs on a request greenlet.

Why this module exists (fork #954)
----------------------------------
``cps/server.py`` serves requests with ``gevent.pywsgi`` and we deliberately
do NOT call ``gevent.monkey.patch_all()`` — the s6 services fork subprocesses
and patching breaks them. Consequences that are easy to forget:

* Every HTTP request is a greenlet, and every greenlet shares ONE OS thread.
* Anything that blocks that thread blocks *the hub*, so no other request is
  served until it returns. It is not "one slow request", it is a frozen app.
* ``concurrent.futures`` is exactly such a blocker. ``as_completed()``,
  ``Future.result()`` and the ``Executor`` context-manager exit (which calls
  ``shutdown(wait=True)``) all park the thread on a ``threading.Condition``
  /``Event``, which gevent cannot preempt. Confirmed with py-spy: the main
  thread sits in ``concurrent.futures._base.wait`` while workers run.

That is what made "Change cover" take the whole app down: the picker fanned
~16 metadata providers out through a ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` and waited on
``as_completed``, so every other user hung for the slowest provider's
timeout. Measured on cwn-local pre-fix: a 30ms book page took 11.4s.

The jobs themselves still need REAL OS threads — providers do blocking
socket reads via ``requests``, and unpatched gevent cannot make those
cooperative. So the answer is not "use greenlets", it is "keep the worker
threads, but wait for them the gevent way":
``gevent.threadpool.ThreadPool`` hands back greenlets whose ``join``/``get``
yield through the hub, while the work still runs on real threads (urllib3's
socket reads and ImageMagick's C code both release the GIL, so throughput is
unchanged).

``cps/services/cover_preview.py`` learned this the hard way for its Wand
pool; this module is the shared, reusable form so the next fan-out does not
have to rediscover it. ``tests/unit/test_request_fanout_gevent_responsiveness.py``
guards the request-path callers against regressing to stdlib futures.

Outside gevent (pytest, the tornado fallback in ``server.py``) there is no
hub to protect, so we use the stdlib executor and behave identically.

    moment THIS job returned, and it is stamped inside the worker rather than
    read when the caller consumes the result. That distinction is load-bearing:
    there are more providers (16) than workers (5), so jobs complete in waves
    and the hub hands several finished jobs back in a single tick. A clock read
    in the consumer loop gives every job in a wave the same reading — observed
    live as 10 of 16 providers all reporting exactly 5316ms — which would make
    the picker's per-provider timings useless for spotting a slow source.

    and comes straight back on the result, so callers can attribute a result
    to its provider without a side table.

    Results are yielded in completion order (not submission order) so callers
    can time each job individually; the picker shows a per-provider duration

    ``fan_out`` covers the many-jobs case. This is the single-job one, and it
    exists because the #954 root cause reaches the app through plain
    sequential calls too, not only through fan-outs (fork #1111):

    * ``cps/editbooks.py`` downloads the cover inline on the edit-book POST,
      so a slow cover CDN froze every other user's page load for up to the
      ``requests`` read timeout of 30s.
    * ``cps/search_metadata.py`` runs a single provider inline for the
      per-provider preview search, which blocks on the provider's own socket
      reads for as long as that provider takes.

    Neither is a fan-out, so neither was reachable by ``fan_out`` — but both
    sit on the request greenlet, which is the only thing that matters here.

    The return value is passed through and exceptions are re-raised in the
    caller (with the worker frame kept in the traceback), so wrapping a call
    site does not change its control flow.

    Uses ONE bounded, shared pool rather than a pool per call. A pool per call
    is unbounded native-thread admission: N concurrent cover saves means N OS
    threads and N outbound sockets, so a burst trades the hub freeze for
    thread/FD exhaustion. Bounding it does not reintroduce the freeze, because
    ``spawn()`` on a saturated gevent pool waits COOPERATIVELY — measured at a
    296ms worst-case hub gap against a 211ms idle baseline while six 1s jobs
    queued through two slots. The submitting request queues; everyone else is
    still served. That is backpressure, which is what we want under load.
