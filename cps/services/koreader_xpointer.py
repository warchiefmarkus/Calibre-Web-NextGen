"""Exact conversion between epub.js CFIs and KOReader (crengine) XPointers (#324).

A highlight made in the web reader is stored as an epub.js CFI; one made in
KOReader arrives as a pair of crengine XPointers such as
``/body/DocFragment[3]/body/div/p[4]/text().845``.  Each reader can only place
its own form, so this module maps one to the other against the book's EPUB.

The two engines see the same XHTML through different lenses, and every rule
below was established from the engines' source and checked against positions
captured from a real device (``tests/fixtures/koreader_xpointer``):

epub.js (``epubcfi.js``, 0.3.93)
  * spine step ``/6/8`` = the package's spine element, then the itemref's
    index among ALL itemrefs; ``[id]`` only when the itemref has an ``id``.
  * element step ``2(n+1)`` = n-th element child; ``[id]`` when it has one.
  * text step ``2k+1`` = k-th TEXT NODE child (not the spec's "gap between
    elements" numbering), whitespace-only nodes included.
  * offsets are UTF-16 code units in the raw DOM text.

crengine (``lvtinydom.cpp`` / ``lvxml.cpp`` / ``epubfmt.cpp``)
  * ``DocFragment[N]``: one per spine itemref whose idref names a manifest
    item (DOM >= 20240114; older DOMs skipped non-XHTML items, so numbering
    is only trusted while every item up to the target is XHTML).
  * element steps count same-named element siblings; the index is omitted
    when the element is its parent's only one of that name (DOM < 20260812;
    newer DOMs always write ``[1]`` -- both forms are accepted on input).
  * text is condensed at parse time: ``\\t \\r \\n`` become spaces and each run
    of spaces becomes ONE space (leading/trailing kept), unless the element
    is ``white-space: pre*``.  Offsets are code points in that text.
  * whitespace-only text nodes: one arriving while a block element has no
    child yet is dropped at parse time; in a block with block children, one
    survives only between two inline siblings (text counts as inline,
    ``display: none`` elements such as ``[hidden]`` or an EPUB page-break span
    do not).  ``text()[k]`` counts the survivors.
  * a text node longer than 8192 source characters is split into several;
    a comment is not a node, but the text either side of it stays two nodes.

Chapters are parsed as strict XML: that is crengine's tree. An ``.html`` or
``.htm`` member is read by epub.js with the browser's HTML parser, so two
leniencies apply there:

  * void elements left open in ``<head>`` -- ``<meta charset="utf-8">``,
    ``<link ...>`` -- are self-closed and the file parsed again, since both
    engines treat them as void. The body must still parse strictly, and the
    refusals below judge the file as written.
  * a self-closed non-void element (``<a id="x"/>``, ``<div/>``: every Project
    Gutenberg chapter) is an OPEN tag to the browser, which then nests what
    follows inside it, while crengine keeps it empty (checked with the engine
    harness). The browser's tree is built with html5lib, the WHATWG algorithm
    browsers implement, and a position crosses between the two trees through
    its text node: the chapter is modelled only when both trees hold the same
    non-whitespace text nodes in the same order (``_BrowserView``); a chapter
    the browser reorders (a table fostering content out) or swallows (``<script/>``)
    is refused, as is every such chapter when html5lib is not installed or the
    chapter is over ``MAX_HTML5_CHAPTER_BYTES``.

Anything outside the modelled subset (pre-formatted text, CSS that may change
an element's display/float/white-space where it matters, markup the browser's
HTML parser would restructure, split text nodes, ...) returns ``None``: an
unresolvable position is reported as such, never moved.
