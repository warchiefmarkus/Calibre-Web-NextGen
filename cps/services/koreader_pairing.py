"""Connect an e-reader with a code (a device authorization grant).

The device asks for a code (:func:`start`), shows it and polls (:func:`poll`).
A signed-in reader types the code on the website, sees which device is asking
and from where, and approves or declines it (:func:`decide`). The first poll
after approval hands the device a newly made app password, exactly once.

Secrets. The ``device_code`` is 256 random bits, given to the device once and
stored only as its SHA-256 digest: a secret that long needs no slow hash, and
a copy of the table lets nobody poll. The app password is made inside the
claim and exists in cleartext only in that one response; app.db keeps its
werkzeug hash like every other app password. The typed ``user_code`` is short
on purpose. It is safe because it lives ten minutes, grants nothing until a
signed-in person approves it, and each network can hold only a few codes
waiting at a time.

Limits count networks, not addresses: an IPv4 address (a home router, a
carrier's shared address) or an IPv6 /64, which one connection can pick
addresses from at will. There is deliberately no server-wide limit: whoever
could fill it would lock every other household out.

Every state change is a conditional UPDATE, so two approvals, or two polls
racing for one approval, cannot both win.

States: pending -> approved -> claimed, or pending -> denied. A row past
``expires_at`` is dead whatever its state, and is deleted by the next
:func:`start` or by ``ub.clean_database`` at startup.
