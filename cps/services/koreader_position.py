"""Exact reading positions between KOReader, the web reader and a Kobo (#324).

KOReader reports its place as a crengine XPointer into the file it holds; the
web reader reports an epub.js CFI into the EPUB it renders. Handing only the
percentage across lands each reader pages away from the other, so this module
converts the position itself (``koreader_xpointer``) -- but only when the
conversion is provably about the same file on both sides:

* the file is identified the way KOReader identifies it, by the partial MD5 of
  its bytes (``checksums/koreader.py``): a device's document digest names the
  file it holds, and the library EPUB's own digest (cached per path, size and
  modification time) names the file the web reader renders;
* a KOReader report is journalled per device with the digest it was sent under
  (``journal_report``), because the shared ``kosync_progress`` row is keyed by
  book id and no longer says which file its XPointer belongs to.

A Kobo's place reaches KOReader the same way (``kobo_position_for_device``):
its ``KoboSpan`` addresses the KEPUB the Kobo holds, and crosses into the
library EPUB through the text the two files share (``kepub_alignment``), when
the span is provably the Kobo's own latest report behind the row and the Kobo
provably holds the library KEPUB as it is now.

Anything short of that proof leaves the hand-off at the percentage, as before.
