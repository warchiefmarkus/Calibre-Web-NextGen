"""Bridge the web reader's position into the shared cross-device progress store (#324).

The web reader keeps its exact position as an epub.js CFI in ``ub.Bookmark``.
Nothing outside the readers reads that row — it is opaque, format-specific and
formerly carried no timestamp — so a browser reading session used to be invisible to the
user's Kobo and to the book-detail progress display.

The portable part of a position is the *percentage*, which the client already
computes (``epub.locations.percentageFromCfi``).  Writing it into
``KoboBookmark.progress_percent`` is what makes it travel:

  * ``cps/kobo.py`` serves that field back to the device as ``ProgressPercent``
    whenever the parent ``KoboReadingState.last_modified`` has advanced past the
    device's sync token (``kobo.py:544`` and ``kobo.py:691``).  The parent bump
    is done for us by the ``before_flush`` listener in ``cps/ub.py``, which
    touches the parent whenever a ``KoboBookmark`` is new or dirty.
  * the classic and SPA book pages read the same field via
    ``helper.get_kosync_progress_display``.

We deliberately reuse KOSync's ``update_book_read_status`` rather than writing
the row here, so the web reader, KOReader and Kobo all converge on one
status-threshold implementation instead of three that can drift.

Reaching KOReader as well (#1366) needs a second carrier, because KOReader
pulls from ``KOSyncProgress`` and never looks at the Kobo bookmark.  What we
must **not** do is write a CFI into that table's ``progress`` column: KOReader
consumes it as an engine-private crengine xpointer (numeric values become a
page number, anything else is applied as an xpointer —
``koreader/plugins/cwngsync.koplugin/main.lua``), so a CFI there is an
unresolvable position.  Instead the row is written with an explicit
percentage-only sentinel and served as ``position_kind: "percentage"``, which
the plugin acts on with ``GotoPercent`` — an event both of KOReader's engines
implement (``ReaderRolling:onGotoPercent``, ``ReaderPaging:onGotoPercent``).
That lands the reader near where the browser stopped rather than exactly there;
an exact hand-off still needs CFI <-> xpointer canonicalization, tracked on
#324.  Clients that have not advertised percentage support never receive these
rows, so this cannot mis-seek an older plugin.

Conflict policy: **furthest wins**, matching the rule KOSync already applies
across devices (``kosync.py:1106``).  Opening a book in the browser therefore
does not regress a device position this request can observe — scoped
deliberately, because acceptance is decided in Python rather than in the
UPDATE, so it is not proof against a device committing inside the read-write
window.  See ``record_web_reader_progress`` for that limit in full.
Deliberately restarting a book stays a "mark unread" action, which clears every
carrier — the position rows via ``helper.reset_reading_position`` and the
read-status tri-state via ``helper.mirror_read_status_to_readbook``, so the
finished-book guard below stays clearable on a custom-read-column install too
(#1343).
