"""Cover-resolution booster for metadata-search results.

Many providers serve thumbnail-sized cover URLs (Hardcover ~290x475, Open
Library "-L" ~500x..., Google Books default ~128 wide). High-DPI e-readers
like the Kobo Libra Color (1264x1680) need ~1500px-wide covers to render
crisply. This module takes the aggregated MetaRecord list from
search_metadata.metadata_search() and, in parallel, looks up a higher-res
alternative for each record, replacing record.cover when one is found.

Sources tried, in order, per record:

  1. Amazon image CDN by ASIN - public CloudFront-fronted host with
     CORS open, no auth, no scraping. Edition-keyed, so we get the
     correct-edition cover at up to ~2000px tall. An ISBN-10 is simply
     the ASIN a print edition happens to have, and is tried first; a
     Kindle edition's own ASIN is tried after it, and is often the only
     key such a book has (fork #304). Validated via HEAD against an
     image/jpeg content-type and a minimum byte count (Amazon serves a
     43-byte GIF placeholder for unknown keys).
  2. iTunes lookup by ISBN - exact-edition match against Apple Books.
  3. iTunes search by title+author - fuzzy match. Only run when the
     record has no ISBN, or as a secondary signal that's gated to within
     a few years of the record's publish year, to avoid swapping a
     correct-edition cover for an unrelated edition Apple happens to
     stock.
  4. Amazon URL rewrite - if the record cover is already an Amazon
     m.media-amazon.com asset with a sizing token, swap to _SL2000_ to
     pull the largest variant Amazon's master serves.

Disable globally with env CWA_COVER_BOOST=0. Tuning knobs:

  CWA_COVER_BOOST_TIMEOUT  - per-lookup HTTP timeout, seconds (default 4)
  CWA_COVER_BOOST_WORKERS  - thread pool size for parallel lookups (default 8)
  CWA_COVER_BOOST_MAX      - cap on records boosted per request (default 30)
  CWA_COVER_BOOST_AMAZON_CDN  - set to 0/false to disable the Amazon
                                image-CDN path (default on)
