"""Helpers for the multi-recipient "Send to eReader" flow.

Fork #276 (@magdalar): an admin who manages a household's eReaders can send a
single book to *other* users' kindle_mail addresses without including any of
their own. In that case the book was relayed, not obtained by the sender, so it
must not be recorded as the sender's own download — otherwise the admin's
download history / "hot books" stats get polluted with books they only passed
along.
