"""Keep reading positions attached to their prose when a book is re-converted.

A Kobo position is ``(chapter file, kobo span)``. Re-converting a book changes
both, and a chapter name is routinely reused for different prose, so presence
of the file proves nothing. The position's text is read from the OLD book while
it still exists and found again in the NEW one; a position whose old book is
gone is re-placed at the same fraction of the new book's text. Device latch
rows are re-armed so the device receives the new anchor after its download.
