--[[
What leaving a book owes the server: its position, its read status and its
highlights, captured while the book is still open and kept on the device until
the server has them. Closing a book or putting the device to sleep never waits
for Wi-Fi; the next connection delivers whatever is waiting.

The queue is keyed by document digest, so the latest capture of a book
replaces an older one. `seq` tells a delivery that finished late whether it
delivered the entry that is still queued or one that has since been replaced.
