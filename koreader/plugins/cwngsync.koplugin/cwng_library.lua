--[[
The CWNG library folder: one EPUB per book in the user's e-reader scope.

A book that is not on the device yet is a placeholder, a small EPUB the server
generates (cover, metadata, one page) so KOReader's own cover grid can show it.
Opening a placeholder downloads the real book over the same path. A book that
leaves the scope is removed again, but a downloaded one only while its bytes
are still exactly what the server sent and it is not open, so nothing a reader
changed on the device is ever deleted by a sync.

This module only decides. `plan` compares the server's manifest with what the
device recorded and what is on disk, and returns actions; the runtime in
main.lua performs them and reports each outcome back through `record`. Keeping
the decision pure is what lets the host-Lua suites exercise every branch
without a device.

State shape (persisted by the runtime):
    { version = 1, revision = <server revision>, books = {
        ["<book_id>"] = { kind = "placeholder"|"downloaded", path, rev,
                          size, mtime, checksum, status, progress } } }
