# Kobo highlight loss — four root causes, all measured on hardware

**Date:** 2026-08-15 · **Reporter:** household instance · **Symptom as reported:**
*"On a Kobo reading a KEPUB, I highlight something, leave the book, come back, and the highlight is gone."*

Everything below was measured, not inferred. The device DB was read over USB from
`/Volumes/KOBOeReader/.kobo/KoboReader.sqlite` (copy it off first — `sqlite3` `mode=ro`
against the mounted volume fails with *unable to open database file*).

## Cause 1 — highlights never render: a `../` OPF href splits the chapter identity

> **A second, much more common way to produce this same split is [Cause 1b](#cause-1b--a-fragment-anchored-toc-wider-than-the--case)
> below** — a TOC that anchors *into* a spine document (`chapter.xhtml#frag`). Measured at **92 of
> 216 books (42.6%)** of one library against 2.3% for the `../` case here, and it accounts for the
> orphans this note originally attributed to "book no longer on the device".

Kobo identifies a chapter as `<book-uuid>!<opf-dir>!<href>`. A `Bookmark` renders only when
`Bookmark.ContentID` **exactly equals** a `content` row with `ContentType=9`. No fuzzy matching.

The affected book's OPF (`OPS/epb.opf`) declared the EPUB3 nav at the ZIP ROOT:

```xml
<item id="nav" href="../nav.xhtml" media-type="application/xhtml+xml" properties="nav"/>
```

Nickel joins `opf_dir + href` **without normalizing `..`**, so:

```
nav path        = "OPS/../nav.xhtml"
nav's directory = "OPS/.."
nav link        = "OPS/chapter-017.xml"
joined          = "OPS/../OPS/chapter-017.xml"   <- what got written to Bookmark.ContentID
```

Both identities are visible side by side in `content`:

| ContentType | ContentID |
|---|---|
| 9 (chapter, used for rendering) | `<uuid>!OPS!chapter-017.xml` |
| 899 (TOC entry) | `<uuid>!OPS!../OPS/chapter-017.xml-2` |

All 88 of the book's `Bookmark` rows carried a form matching neither table → **0 matches** →
nothing drawn. (Not literally the `ContentType=899` value either — see Cause 1b below.)
A control book returned `matching content row exists: 1`; this book returned `0`.

**Census query — orphaned highlights, device-wide:**

```sql
select b.VolumeID, count(*) n,
  sum(case when exists(select 1 from content c where c.ContentID=b.ContentID) then 1 else 0 end) matched
from Bookmark b group by b.VolumeID;
```

907 of 3016 were orphaned.

🚨 **CORRECTED 2026-08-16 — the original reading of 810 of those was WRONG, and the error is
instructive.** This note first said Iliad (584), King in Yellow (220) and Republic (6) had *no*
`ContentType=9` rows because the book had been removed from the device, and were therefore not
repairable. **All 810 are repairable**, and the books were never gone.

The mistake was the probe: chapter rows were looked for with `ContentID LIKE VolumeID || '%'`, which
returns zero for a `file:///mnt/onboard/...` volume **regardless of whether the book is present** —
because those volumes' chapter ids are not prefixed by the volume path. "No rows found" was read as
"book removed" when it meant "this query cannot see this volume shape".

**The control that settles it: the Odyssey.** Same `file:///` volume shape, 400 bookmarks,
**400/400 rendering**, and zero fragments. A "book is gone" explanation cannot survive it.

The real second cause is a **fragment-anchored TOC** — see below. Verified on the same backup:

| volume | bookmarks | anchored | carry `#` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Iliad | 608 | 24 | **584** |
| King in Yellow | 221 | 1 | **220** |
| Odyssey | 400 | **400** | 0 |
| three others | 873 | 873 | 0 |

```
fragmented: 810     repairable (exact ContentType=9 match after stripping '#'): 810
```

**Generalises:** a negative from a query is only as good as a positive control run through the same
query. The `LIKE VolumeID || '%'` probe was never validated against a volume known to work.

---

## Cause 1b — a fragment-anchored TOC (wider than the `../` case)

The `Bookmark.ContentID` matches **neither** the chapter row **nor** the TOC row. It is a *third*
form — the opf directory joined to the **raw TOC href**, without the `-N` disambiguator the
`ContentType=899` rows carry:

| what | ContentID |
|---|---|
| `ContentType=9` (what rendering looks up) | `…!OEBPS!…541-h-0.htm.xhtml` |
| `ContentType=899` (the TOC entry) | `…!OEBPS!…541-h-0.htm.xhtml#pgepubid00005`**`-2`** |
| **`Bookmark.ContentID`** | `…!OEBPS!…541-h-0.htm.xhtml#pgepubid00005` |

`matches_899 = 0/3`, `matches_9 = 0/3`. **This also sharpens Cause 1 above:** those Flatland
bookmarks were not carrying "the TOC-derived form" in the 899 sense either — the 899 row was
`<uuid>!OPS!../OPS/chapter-017.xml-2` while the Bookmark was `OPS/../OPS/chapter-017.xml`. Both
bugs are the same third form. **ASSUMED:** the exact derivation rule; the two observed cases differ
in whether the `<uuid>!<opf-dir>!` prefix survives, and that is not established.

The exact match against `ContentType=9` therefore fails:

```
Bookmark.ContentID     <uuid>!OEBPS!..._541-h-0.htm.xhtml#pgepubid00005
content ContentType=9  <uuid>!OEBPS!..._541-h-0.htm.xhtml
```

Measured on a Clara BW / **4.45.23792**, both books converted by current `main`: **1984** — 6 highlights, 6
anchored, TOC carries 0 fragments. **The Age of Innocence** — 3 highlights, **0 anchored**, all 42
TOC links carry a fragment. Both OPF manifests are clean.

⚠️ **The defect is entirely in the NCX, so #1637 does not touch it, and we ship these today.**
**92 of 216 books (42.6%)** have a fragment-anchored TOC — against #1637's 5 of 216.

### Two fixes that look obvious and are both wrong

**Stripping fragments from the NCX is NOT a fix.** The fragment is load-bearing navigation:
collapsing it would put Age of Innocence's 42 TOC targets onto 7 documents, and Dune's 1,780 onto a
handful. That trades invisible highlights for a broken table of contents.

**Normalising server-side does NOT fix rendering.** #1638 normalises the `content_id` *we* store,
which is right for our records, but the row Nickel draws from lives on the device. No server-side
change can make its exact match succeed.

**Why 1984 works** is the clue to the real shape: it was already split into per-chapter files, so
every TOC href targets a whole document and carries no fragment. The discriminator is not "the TOC
has fragments" but **"the TOC targets a position inside a document rather than a document"**.

So the candidate fix is splitting spine documents at TOC anchor targets during conversion — the
shape already hardware-proven by 1984. ⚠️ **Not yet designed or shipped, deliberately:** regenerating
a KEPUB shifts KoboSpan ids, so doing this to 92 of 216 books in a live library is a mass
re-anchoring event that would invalidate highlights users already hold. Any such fix needs a story
for books that already carry highlights, and probably applies to new conversions only.

**The 810-highlight recovery is independent of all of this** and stands alone: stripping the
fragment from `Bookmark.ContentID` re-anchors every one, with no conversion change.

### ✅ ANSWERED 2026-08-16 — `checkforchanges` triggers an authoritative replacement

🚨 **CORRECTION:** the open question above is now settled. Nickel did not independently prune the
unanchored rows. On both book open and book close it emitted, in order:

```
PUT   /kobo/<tok>/v1/library/<uuid>/state
PATCH /api/v3/content/<uuid>/annotations
POST  /api/v3/content/checkforchanges
GET   /api/v3/content/<uuid>/annotations?limit=100
```

The final GET occurred **only when** the `checkforchanges` response named that `ContentId`. Nickel
then replaced the content's entire local `Bookmark` set with exactly what the GET produced,
including destroying rows the response did not mention. Serving one annotation replaced three
local rows with that one row.

All of these trigger cases were observed on a Clara BW running firmware 4.45.23792:

| `checkforchanges` / annotation result | observed device result |
|---|---|
| `checkforchanges` returns `[]` | no GET; no local deletion |
| GET returns 200 with N annotations | local set becomes exactly those N |
| GET returns 503 | local set becomes empty |
| GET hangs | local set becomes empty |

The #1636 refusal therefore caused the Clara deletion it was intended to prevent. Filtering
CWNG-owned ContentIds out of `checkforchanges` was measured across three open/close cycles: the GET
was never issued, no highlights were deleted, and PATCH uploads continued to return 204.

**Library scan:** 5 of 216 books (2.3%) carry an escaping OPF href, every one `../nav.xhtml`.
Perfect correlation on the instance: every book with one has **zero** stored annotations ever;
all 604 stored annotations come from books without one.

**Repair** (device in USB mass-storage mode, Nickel not running): `UPDATE Bookmark SET ContentID`
to `<uuid>!<opf-dir>!<normpath(href)>`, scoped by `VolumeID`. Verify each target has a
`ContentType='9'` row first; hash every other volume's rows before/after to prove isolation. PK is
`BookmarkID`, so rewriting `ContentID` cannot collide. 88/88 restored this way.

**Durable fix:** normalize escaping manifest hrefs during EPUB→KEPUB conversion (PR #1637).

## Cause 2 — highlights are then DELETED: `checkforchanges` triggers an authoritative replacement

This is upstream [calibre-web #2610](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/issues/2610), open
since 2022 and never root-caused because nobody had read the device DB during the event.

CWNG advertises itself as `reading_services_host` whenever Kobo sync is on, then forwards
`GET /api/v3/content/<uuid>/annotations` to `readingservices.kobo.com`.

🚨 **CORRECTED 2026-08-16:** the original claim that **Kobo's cloud has never heard of a sideloaded
book** is false. Kobo's cloud does store annotations for sideloaded books; proxying the GET restored
two previously deleted highlights verbatim. The destructive mechanism is broader: when
`checkforchanges` names a ContentId, Nickel issues the GET and replaces its entire local Bookmark
set with exactly the returned annotations. A 200 containing one row replaced three local rows with
one, while a 503 and a hung GET both replaced the set with empty.

```
11:58   88 highlights present and correctly anchored (after the Cause-1 repair)
12:07   one sync:  1 annotation PATCHed up
                   GET .../annotations?limit=100  -> proxied to Kobo
after   0 Bookmark rows for that book
```

**87 deleted, never uploaded.** The server held exactly 1 of 88. For a sideloaded book the device is
frequently the only copy, so a 200-empty here is a **destructive operation even though the verb is
GET**.

⚠️ **Repairing Cause 1 EXPOSES annotations to Cause 2.** While the ContentIDs were malformed the
rows were invisible to the sync reconciliation and survived; making them well-formed made them
eligible for deletion. **Fix the server before repairing a device.**

🚨 **CORRECTED 2026-08-16 — PR #1636 DID NOT WORK:** returning **503 + `Retry-After`** is not a safe
refusal. Nickel treats the failure as an empty authoritative set and deletes every local row. The
proven containment is earlier: strip every CWNG-owned ContentId from the outbound
`checkforchanges` request and defensively from its response. When no ids remain, answer `[]`
without contacting Kobo. Nickel then issues no GET at all, while PATCH upload remains untouched.

Deliberately **not** answering with our own snapshot: an internally-complete server view would tell
a second device to drop annotations it has not uploaded yet, and a regenerated KEPUB shifts KoboSpan
ids so a correct-looking snapshot installs misplaced anchors.

---

## Cause 3 (ours) — the server was discarding every Kobo highlight

Independent of the device, #1531 added content-id validation to `_upsert_annotation` whose failure
path was `return None`, discarding the whole annotation over a derived, nullable, recomputable
field. Deployed 2026-08-13 18:38:11; first discard 18:40:37; **95 highlights across 95 distinct ids
destroyed in under 48 hours**, zero annotations stored for any book in that window.

It shipped because the gate was dead code in tests: the dispatcher fixture's `_book()` is a
`SimpleNamespace` with no `uuid`, so the branch was never entered.

Fixed in #1635 (never discard) and #1638 (normalize contained traversals so `content_id` is correct
rather than NULL). The validator was *right* that the value was malformed — it was the canary for
Cause 1 — but it was wrong to charge the user for the discovery.

## 🚨 Re-read `.kobo/version` at the moment of measurement

A Kobo **self-updates as soon as it has Wi-Fi**, without being asked. The Clara BW above went from
4.42.23291 to 4.45.23792 at 20:30:52 in the middle of this session, and several findings were first
written up against the version read an hour earlier.

**A run attributed to the wrong firmware is worse than a run not done**, because it looks like
evidence and will be cited as a data point. Read the version file as part of taking the
measurement, not as part of setting up the device.

Firmware seen so far, for anyone building a behaviour picture:

| firmware | device | what it showed |
|---|---|---|
| 4.41 | Clara Colour (upstream reporter) | could not reproduce the Cause-2 deletion at all |
| 4.42.23291 | Clara BW | first library sync clean — 216 books, 3 pages, terminated |
| 4.45.23792 | Clara BW | Cause 1b above, and the open deletion question |
| 4.45.23697 | Libra Colour | Cause 1/2/3 as originally documented |
