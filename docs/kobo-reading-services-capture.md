# Kobo private exchange capture

This diagnostic is for short, operator-controlled hardware experiments. It is
off by default and cannot be enabled with an ordinary boolean value.

Enable it by setting this exact environment value and restarting CWNG:

```text
CWNG_KOBO_READING_SERVICES_CAPTURE=I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_CAPTURES_PRIVATE_READING_DATA
```

Unset the variable and restart immediately after the experiment. Values such as
`1`, `true`, different case, or values with surrounding whitespace do not
enable capture.

**Captured request and response bodies are raw, not hashed or redacted.** They
can contain book titles, reading data, endpoint and download paths, and other
library metadata. Library-sync capture also deliberately stores the exact raw
incoming and outgoing opaque sync tokens. This is why the gate names private
reading data and why these records must remain local and short-lived. The
ordinary `Kobo Sync summary` INFO line is separate: it contains only structural
counters, cursor values, a capture ID, and a short hash of the device ID; it
does not log raw titles, paths, user/device identifiers, or opaque sync tokens.

Records are written to:

```text
<config>/.cwng-private-observability/kobo-reading-services/
```

In the standard container `<config>` is `/config`. The directory is mode 0700
and each `exchange-*.json.gz` record is mode 0600. Records are not copied into
the annotation backup format or the support debug ZIP, and no record belongs in
a repository, issue attachment, or other shared artifact. External backup jobs
that archive all of `/config` should explicitly exclude
`.cwng-private-observability/`.

Each schema-version-3 record contains:

- explicit request provenance (`authenticated`, `unauthenticated`, or
  `not_recorded`) and a local user ID only when one was authenticated;
- the device request body and redacted headers;
- `checkforchanges` decisions in original array order, including ownership,
  observed authority state, and whether each ID was suppressed or proxied;
- the exact request body actually sent to Kobo after filtering;
- Kobo's raw response body and redacted headers; and
- the final status, redacted headers, and exact body returned to the device.

Library-sync (`/v1/library/sync`) records use the same directory, file layout,
size bounds, and retention policy. They contain the exact response body (which
can include the user's library metadata), the incoming and outgoing opaque sync
tokens, `x-kobo-sync`, the request's device ID hashed to the same short label as
the INFO summary, and a structured pointer to that summary's counters. The raw
device ID is not recorded.

Bodies carry byte length and SHA-256 metadata. UTF-8 bodies are stored directly;
any non-UTF-8 body is base64 encoded. Credential-like headers—including
Authorization, cookies, Kobo user keys, API keys, secrets, and tokens—are
replaced with `***REDACTED***` in every generic header leg. Library-sync's
incoming and outgoing opaque tokens are deliberately retained in its private
`sync_exchange` section so an interrupted page chain can be reconstructed.

Retention is automatic and cross-process locked: at most 256 records, 64 MiB
compressed total, seven days, and 16 MiB for any individual body. An exchange
above the body limit is skipped whole rather than saved partially. Blocking
capture storage runs outside the gevent hub with a 100 ms request deadline.
Any observer or storage failure is logged only with structural metadata and
cannot replace, retry, or change the response being observed.

### Unauthenticated annotation PATCH refusals

When the private-data gate is enabled, an annotation PATCH refused with 401 is
captured before the refusal. Its record is explicitly marked
`authentication: unauthenticated` and `user_id: null`; the route does not guess
an owner from entitlement IDs, device headers, cookies, or request metadata.
The request is never admitted to the recovery spool because there is no safe
replay principal and unresolved spool records are intentionally non-evictable.

This unauthenticated diagnostic has a separate directory and retention budget:

```text
<config>/.cwng-private-observability/kobo-reading-services-unauthenticated/
```

It is capped at 32 records, 8 MiB compressed total, and 1 MiB for an individual
body. Records older than 24 hours are pruned when the next unauthenticated
capture is persisted; 24 hours is therefore an age target, not a wall-clock
maximum during a quiet period. Requests without a bounded `Content-Length` or
beyond 1 MiB are refused normally but not read or captured. The diagnostic
remains off by default; when it is off, the auth gate does not consume the
request body.
Unauthenticated churn therefore cannot evict authenticated exchange captures
or any always-on recovery record.

## Annotation PATCH recovery spool

Independently of the opt-in observer, every annotation PATCH body is staged to
durable local storage before JSON parsing, ownership dispatch, or annotation
persistence begins. This is an always-on data-integrity mechanism, not a
diagnostic gate. Its records live at:

```text
<config>/.cwng-private-observability/kobo-patch-spool/
```

The spool stores the exact raw body as base64 plus its byte length and SHA-256,
the entitlement/user/origin-device identifiers needed to route a controlled
replay, and one processing outcome: `staged`, `dispatch_refused`,
`dispatch_exception`, or `dispatch_completed`. It never stores request headers.
A completed record is retained too because completion of the route does not
prove that every member commit succeeded. Replay is deliberately a server-side
operator action; CWNG does not automatically reapply a PATCH or risk applying
the same delta twice.
`cps.services.kobo_patch_spool.iter_replay_candidates()` identifies definitely
interrupted records and `load_spooled_patch(path)` verifies the stored length
and digest before returning the original bytes.

The spool uses a mode-0700 private parent and mode-0600 gzip records. Before a
stage is reported successful, the record and every newly created directory
entry have been fsynced. Blocking storage work runs outside the gevent hub and
the request waits at most 100 ms; timeout, lock contention, or any storage
failure degrades to no new recovery record without changing the PATCH route.

It is capped at 512 files, 64 MiB compressed total, 14 days, and 16 MiB per
PATCH body. `staged`, `dispatch_refused`, and `dispatch_exception` records are
protected: when the only way to admit a new body would be to remove one, the
new body is not staged. Retries with the same user, entitlement, origin device, and exact body
refresh one record regardless of the previous outcome; they do not consume
additional slots. The refreshed record is protected until that attempt finishes.
This identity rule also applies to bodies CWNG cannot parse or fully persist:
the refusal remains replayable because complete persistence is unproven.
Only completed records are evictable to admit distinct bodies.
Evictable records are moved through a durable transaction so a failed new write
restores the prior record set. A deadline-driven maintenance worker enforces
the age limit even while no new PATCHes arrive. An oversized
body or any storage failure is reported without body content and cannot change
parsing, dispatch, the existing ownership-unknown 503, or the upstream response
returned to the Kobo. The same repository, support-bundle, and external-backup
exclusions described above apply.
