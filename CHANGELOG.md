# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Calibre-Web NextGen. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

**Docker tags:** `:latest` = newest stable release · `:dev` = every merge to main
(canary channel — what the maintainers run at home) · `:vX.Y.Z` = immutable pins
for rollback.

**Compatibility promise:** patch releases (`vX.Y.Z` → `vX.Y.Z+1`) are safe to
auto-update — no breaking config, database, or API changes without a `BREAKING`
callout at the top of the release notes.

Internal refactors, CI changes, and test-only work don't appear here — this file
is for things you can see or feel when running the app.

## [Unreleased]

## [v4.1.45] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Magic Shelves can filter on when a book was last modified.** "Last
  Modified" now sits next to Date Added and Publication Date in the rule
  builder, in both the classic and the New UI, with the same options, including
  "in the last N days". A shelf of books updated in the last 30 days keeps
  moving on its own, which suits web serials and other books that are re-fetched
  as new chapters come out. Last Modified changes whenever a book's metadata,
  cover or files change, so a bulk edit or metadata fetch moves every book it
  touches into such a shelf. Custom date columns in the classic builder now get
  the same date-format hint and check as the built-in date fields. Thanks to
  @trallen. (#2364)

- **The New UI's Advanced search can filter on custom columns.** Every
  custom column you can see gets a field, the same ones the classic search
  has: a From/To range for numbers and dates, Yes/No/Empty for Yes/No
  columns, the column's own values for fixed lists, a star count for ratings,
  and "contains" for text. The criteria stay in the page address and in a
  saved default library view. Reported in #2365.

- **Book covers in the new UI show which shelves each book is on.** The
  classic library grid put a shelf tag on each cover, and the new UI never
  did, so the only way to see where a book was filed was to open "Add to
  shelf" on it. Covers now carry up to two shelf names in the top corner, with
  a "+N" tag naming any others. You only see your own shelves and public ones;
  another reader's private shelf is never shown. On a shelf's own page that
  shelf's tag is left out. **View settings → Show shelf tags** turns them off,
  and it is the same setting as the classic grid's "Hide shelf badges on
  covers", so both views agree. Requested by @lguerard (#1254) and through the
  feedback form (#2261).

- **Calibre-Web NextGen is now fully translated into Slovak.** Every remaining
  string in the Slovak catalog — the new interface, My Library, magic and
  smart shelves, Kobo and KOReader pairing, cover designer, duplicates manager,
  annotations and the NextGen admin pages — is translated. Existing Slovak
  strings were aligned with the Calibre-Web-Automated Slovak translation, which
  also fixes a number of typos and missing diacritics.

### Changed

- **Reverse-proxy headers are believed only from where a proxy sits.** CWNG
  reads the client's address, scheme and host from `X-Forwarded-For`,
  `X-Forwarded-Proto` and the other proxy headers. It now does so only when the
  connection comes from this host, a private network (the docker network, your
  LAN) or a Tailscale tailnet. Anything else is taken at its own address. Most
  setups need no change. If your proxy reaches CWNG from a public address, add
  it to the new `TRUSTED_PROXY_NETWORKS` setting. The common case is
  Cloudflare's proxy forwarding straight to the container, with no proxy of
  your own in between. Set it to `*` to trust every peer as before. The log
  names any peer whose proxy headers are ignored. Write `private` in the list
  to keep the default networks alongside your proxy.

### Fixed

- **Reading in the web reader now updates your progress on Hardcover.** Before, only a Kobo or KOReader reached Hardcover; reading in the browser moved your place on your devices but not there. With Hardcover sync on and your own API key set, your place goes to Hardcover in the background as you read, with the same limits as your devices: a book needs a `hardcover-id`, page progress needs an edition, and a place behind one your devices already reported isn't sent. Also, a book you finish at 99% or more (where CWNG already counts it as finished) is now marked Read on Hardcover. Before, it stayed on "Currently Reading". Thanks to @ashtakom (#2289).

- **"Force full kobo sync" is back, now in the new UI.** When Kobo pairing moved to Account → E-readers, the button that makes your Kobo receive your whole library again stayed behind on the classic profile page. It's now under the Stock Kobo sync URL on the e-reader page. It asks before it does anything, and your Kobo gets every book again on its next sync. Admins still use the classic user page to do this for another user. Thanks to @Glennza1962 (#2334).

- **The top bar no longer scrolls away on the Devices pages.** On
  Account → Devices and browsers (and each device's page) the top bar scrolled
  off with the page while the sidebar stayed put, leaving an empty band above
  it. The bar now stays at the top like everywhere else, and keyboard focus
  still stops below it on long device lists. (#2341)

- **"Pin sidebar" moved to the foot of the sidebar.** In the collapsed desktop
  sidebar it left an empty slot above Library; it now sits at the bottom and
  stays in reach while a long sidebar scrolls. (#2341)

- **Paging a device's library keeps your place.** Next and Previous in a
  device's library list used to drop keyboard focus and leave the page
  scrolled to wherever the pager had been. Now you land on the new page's
  status line, at the top of the device card. (#2341)

- **"Recent" no longer lists every book you have finished first.** The Library's
  Recent order is meant to put the books you are reading on top, then everything
  else newest added. It was also counting finished books as "reading", so anyone
  with a long reading history had to scroll past all of them to reach anything
  unread. A finished book now takes its date-added place with the rest, and
  starting it over brings it back to the top. When read status is kept in a
  Calibre Yes/No column, that column decides what counts as finished. (#2360)

- **"Edit default view" opens the form on your saved view.** It used to open
  an empty search form.

- **Split libraries: importing a book no longer logs "Error generating book checksums: no such table: books" or leaves an empty `metadata.db` in your book folder.** With KOReader sync on and book files stored separately from the library database, the post-import step looked for the database in the book folder, so new books had no KOReader sync checksums until the next container restart filled them in. The empty (0-byte) `metadata.db` that earlier imports left in the book folder is safe to delete. Reported and first fixed by @sgreadly (#2371, #2372).

- **Adding a book to a user's library from User administration now confirms it
  where you added it.** The confirmation used to appear at the top of the page,
  off-screen by the time you had scrolled to that user's card, so the add looked
  silent. It now shows next to the "Add book to this library" button in that
  user's card. Reported by @vinxa.

- **Edit metadata is back on the book page's button row.** In the new UI the
  row showed Edit cover and hid Edit metadata inside the gear menu, so the
  more common edit took two clicks. Anyone who can edit a book now gets Edit
  metadata in the row; Edit cover stays in the gear menu and on the metadata
  editor. A reader who can only change their own cover still sees Edit cover
  in the row. Reported by @magdalar (#2338).

- **Installs outside Docker can set their Calibre library from the Database
  Configuration page again.** On a native Windows or bare-metal install the
  "Location of Calibre Database" field was read-only and its folder button did
  nothing, so a first run had no way to point the app at a library short of
  editing `app.db` by hand. The field is now locked only inside the container,
  where the startup library scan picks the library on every boot; elsewhere,
  and in the container when `DISABLE_LIBRARY_AUTOMOUNT=true`, you can type the
  path or browse to it. Reported by @Rol3333 (#2343).

- **Deleting a user now removes everything the server kept for that
  account.** The account's e-readers and browsers (with their names and
  sync records), KOReader reading positions, magic shelves, favourites,
  personal covers, cover-design presets, linked sign-in providers and
  notices used to stay behind after an admin deleted the user. They are now
  deleted with it. A public shelf or magic shelf the user owned is deleted
  too, as public shelves always were, along with other readers' hidden or
  cached copies of it. Deleting a book now also removes the delivery records
  that belonged to its highlights on each e-reader.

- **Removing several files from a KOReader device now takes one sync, not one sync per file.** Marking multiple files for removal on the Devices page and then running "Sync now" in the CWNGSync plugin removed only one of them; each later sync removed one more. The plugin now works through the whole removal queue in a single sync (up to 50 files at a time, with the rest picked up on the next sync). A file the device declines to remove is reported back and no longer holds up the others. Reported in [#2328](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/2328) by @magdalar.

- **Books with a lone "—" or "©" in their metadata no longer come out of import with garbled text like "Ghostâ€”Spectres".** With the Kindle EPUB fixer on, a book whose metadata file (or stylesheet) had no encoding declaration and contained just one character like an em dash or a copyright sign could be misread, so a title such as "Ghost—Spectres" was saved as "Ghostâ€”Spectres" in your library and in the book's folder name. With the fixer's aggressive mode on, accented titles such as "Café" could be damaged the same way ("Caf√©"). Text like this is now read as the UTF-8 it is. Books already imported this way keep the damaged text until you fix the title or import them again from the original file. Thanks to @sgreadly for the report and the fix.

- **Moving your library no longer makes Kobos download their books again.**
  Copying a library to a new disk without keeping file times, or moving the
  server to a new address, used to mark every book on a Kobo as changed the
  next time it synced after an interrupted sync or a shelf edit, and the Kobo
  then downloaded each one again. Books you have really edited, a new cover
  included, still update on the device.

- **Undated books are no longer re-sent to Kobo when the server's Python version or operating system changes.**
  Books with no publication date were described to Kobo slightly differently
  depending on the Python version and operating system running the server, so
  moving an install (for example from a Mac source install to the Docker image)
  made every Kobo re-download those books and lose its place in them. The dates
  are now written the same way everywhere, and a Kobo that last synced with the
  other form keeps its books.

- **Two e-readers set up by copying the koreader folder no longer show up as
  one device.** Copying KOReader's settings from one Kindle or Kobo to another
  also copied its sync ID, so the server merged both e-readers into one device
  and each skipped the other's reading progress as its own. The CWNG Sync
  plugin now notices when its settings came from a different e-reader, gives
  that e-reader its own ID, and says so once. Other KOReader devices keep
  their ID unchanged. E-readers set up by copying before this update still
  share an ID: delete the `["device_id"]` line from `koreader/settings.reader.lua`
  on one of them, as described in #2351. (#2351, reported by @befeil)

- **KOReader no longer freezes while it collects books sent from the website.**
  When several books were waiting, KOReader downloaded them back to back and
  ignored taps until the last one arrived. It now reads taps between books
  (#2329).

- **KOReader no longer freezes when you turn on Library mode.** Library mode
  downloaded a placeholder for every book one after another, and KOReader
  read no taps until the last one arrived. On Android that looked like
  "KOReader isn't responding". KOReader now reads taps between downloads.
  Progress is saved every few books, so restarting KOReader no longer starts
  the download over. Placeholders are no longer counted as books on the
  device's page, even after a restart. Turning Library mode on from the menu
  now leaves your home folder alone, and turning it off restores the home
  folder settings that setup changed. Reported by @magdalar (#2329).

- **Sign-in and Kobo sync keep working when the rate limiter's external store goes down.**
  With the limiter pointed at Redis or Memcached, an outage of that store made
  every Kobo sync fail with "too many requests", refused web sign-ins with
  "contact your administrator", and could answer a right password with a server
  error. The limits now carry on in the server's own memory until the store
  comes back, so everyone can still sign in and repeated wrong passwords are
  still slowed down.

- **An e-reader moved to another account now registers there.** A KOReader
  device or Kobo that was used with one account and then paired to another on
  the same server was refused as a device for the new account, so Send to
  device, its device page, the book list it reports and removing books from it
  all failed. Each account now gets its own entry for the reader. Switching
  back finds the first account's entry again with its name and history, and
  neither account can see or change the other's.

- **Turning a page while a book opens no longer loses your place from your
  e-reader.** When a book had a KOReader or Kobo position and the New UI reader
  opened it at the start while it worked out where that position was, a page
  turn in those first seconds saved the start of the book as your place, and
  the reader never took you to the synced position again. Those early page
  turns now wait for the jump, which still happens. If you pick a chapter,
  link, highlight or search result in that time, the reader keeps your choice
  and offers the synced position instead.

- **A settings page that fails validation no longer undoes a background
  task's progress.** Reloading settings after a rejected change now reads
  what is stored, so a finished KEPUB repair or backfill is not scheduled to
  run again in the same session.

- **Saving settings works again after the server recovers from a database
  error.** Once the web session had to be reset after a failed rollback, every
  admin settings save failed until the server was restarted.

- **A local-only account can sign in to the New UI when LDAP cannot.** The
  `/app/` sign-in endpoint now falls back to the stored local password after
  the directory rejects the account or cannot be reached, matching the classic
  `/login` form, so an administrator of an LDAP instance is not locked out
  during a directory outage. Reported by @justemu.

- **KOReader sync and OPDS sign-ins now slow down password guessing without
  locking out your devices.** A device or app that keeps sending *different*
  wrong passwords for an account is refused for a minute after three. A device
  stuck on an old or revoked password is sending the same wrong password each
  time, so it gets "wrong password", never a lockout. Your other devices, and a
  right password on the same home network, keep signing in straight away.
  Devices that sign in with an app password are never slowed. A sign-in your
  LDAP directory could not answer because it was down is not counted, so the
  right password works as soon as the directory is back; the same goes for a
  directory user's first OPDS sign-in when creating their account fails.
  Before, KOReader sync did not slow wrong passwords at all. OPDS paced every
  sign-in to an account together, so one misconfigured reader app could keep
  the account's other OPDS apps waiting.

- **Books copied onto the server by a sync tool now appear without "Reconnect
  Calibre Database".** Tools such as rsync, Syncthing and NAS sync apps replace
  `metadata.db` with a new file, and the server kept reading the old one until
  someone reconnected by hand. The server now notices the replaced file within
  a few seconds and switches to it on its own (#2291, thanks @Dirk71).

- **Long-running servers no longer creep towards "too many open files".**
  Each run of a background task (thumbnails, temp-folder cleanup, KEPUB
  repair, annotation backup and sync, conversions) opened a fresh connection
  pool to the app database, and many of those connections stayed open until the
  server restarted. Each task's connection now closes when the task finishes.

## [v4.1.44] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- **Book details now show how many saved highlights and notes the current user has, without an extra page request.** The Highlights button stays unchanged when the count is zero. Thanks to @iroQuai for the suggestion and for clarifying the intended behavior.

- **The desktop New-UI sidebar can stay expanded.** Pin the rail in one click to
  reserve its full width across navigation and reloads, then unpin it to restore
  hover expansion. Reported by @xVolta and @iroQuai.

- **Kobo sync now warns when a fresh response or stored pending-page replay has
  at least 4096 bytes of application response headers.** The warning reports only
  header/token byte counts and store-proxy enablement, and points to the existing
  README nginx buffer-size remedy. Diagnostic failures leave delivery unchanged.

- **Bulk metadata can add to a book's existing values instead of wiping them.**
  Selecting books in the New UI and applying Tags, Authors, Publishers or
  Languages now offers an explicit **Add to existing** / **Replace existing**
  choice, and Add is the default. Adding `sci-fi` across twenty books keeps the
  tags each of them already had. Replacing still works, but it now says how many
  books will lose their values and asks first. Single-value fields — Series —
  are unaffected by the choice. Requested by @neontapir.

- **Each account can now keep its own selection of books, out of one shared library.** Useful on a
  server holding a big archive where one person only reads a few dozen of them. There is still one copy
  of each file on disk and one set of metadata — only *which books you keep* is per-account, so two
  readers can both have a book without there being two copies of it.

  **Upgrading changes nothing.** Every existing and new account stays in *the whole library* mode, which
  is exactly how the server behaved before. Nothing switches on by itself and no book moves.

  When you do switch an account to *my selection*, it starts out holding everything that account can
  already see, so the change is invisible on day one — including on an e-reader, which keeps every book
  it already had. Pruning afterwards is a book-at-a-time decision. Switching back and forth loses
  nothing: your selection is restored exactly, even if you had deliberately emptied it.

  **Removing a book from your library deletes nothing** — not the file, not the metadata, not your
  highlights, notes or reading position. Add it back later and your notes and your place in the book are
  where you left them. It does drop the book from your own shelves, and re-adding does not put it back
  on them. If you have an e-reader, the book leaves the device on its next update, and the confirmation
  says so before you commit. Deleting a book *from the global library* is a separate, clearly separated
  action that still erases it for everyone.

  Accounts allowed to browse the whole archive get a **Global Library** section — everything on the
  server, with a *recently added that you don't have* view — and can switch their own mode; for other
  accounts an administrator manages it. Administrators can move one account or every account at once
  (safe to re-run, never re-seeds), and can put a specific book into a managed account's selection.
  Shelves, search, facet counts, OPDS and Kobo sync all follow the account's selection. Adding a book to
  a shelf, or uploading one, adds it to your library first — you cannot shelve or upload into a library
  you cannot see. Both the new and classic interfaces have the whole feature.

  ⚠️ **My Library is a curation tool, not a privacy boundary.** It decides what an account sees by
  default, not what it is permitted to reach. To actually keep books away from an account, use the
  existing allowed/denied tags or the restricted custom column, which are enforced separately and still
  apply.

  Two notes for people running a proxy or a bare-metal install: responses whose contents depend on who
  asked now send `Cache-Control: private, no-store` and identity-aware `Vary` headers, so a reverse proxy
  must not reuse cached OPDS or library responses across accounts; and a SQLite build without JSON
  support uses a slower but correct fallback rather than failing. The classic library's saved
  newest-sort key is renamed internally, which resets an existing saved *newest* selection once.

  Implements [#1939](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1939).

- **Regular and smart shelves in the New UI now have Select mode and the same
  bulk actions as the catalog.** Personal Library users can remove several
  shelved books from their library at once. Selection survives loading more
  books, successful changes refresh the grid, and failed books stay selected for
  retry. Shelf reordering and the individual Remove from shelf action remain
  available. Long shelf names wrap on narrow screens so the floating bulk actions
  stay visible and reachable on phones. Addresses iroQuai’s feedback on fork
  issue #1939.

- **Owned Kobo annotations can become safely server-authoritative without a
  manual database edit.** CWNG captures the complete upstream annotation set
  per active Kobo, preserves its exact pages, and keeps unsafe or oversized
  sets proxied instead of serving a destructive subset.

- **Reading positions are now retained per Kobo and browser device.** A
  re-downloaded Kobo book receives its resolved reading state on a subsequent,
  bounded sync page even when the normal reading-state cursor is already
  ahead. The response which offers replacement bytes only arms the repair;
  byte-identical entitlement replays remain suppressed without re-arming it.

- **Every registered Kobo, KOReader, and browser now has its own data page.**
  The page separates highlights, standalone notes, dog-ears, reading positions,
  and the device's reported library, with an explicit switch between origin and
  current assignment.

- **Administrators can inspect the cross-account device fleet.** The board shows
  privacy-safe device metadata, per-class annotation counts, and Kobo authority
  coverage without exposing installation identifiers or identity fingerprints.

- **A shelf in the new UI now has a sort dropdown, matching the classic UI.** Sort by title, author or date, or keep the shelf's hand-arranged **Manual order** — which stays the default. Unlike the classic UI's sorter, choosing a sort here only changes what you see: your manual arrangement is never rewritten, and the Reorder control is hidden while a sorted view is active so a drag can't overwrite it. Your choice is remembered per shelf. Thanks to @Zenloth for the report.

- **Kobo sync now sends books marked read through a configured Calibre custom
  column as `Finished`.** Kobo completions update that same column.

- **Custom columns that use Calibre's dotted sub-groups can be browsed as a tree in the classic UI
  and over OPDS.** A value like `Computers.DB.Oracle` now shows under Computers › DB › Oracle, and
  opening a level lists its books together with everything filed beneath it. Each such column
  gets its own sidebar entry, which you can switch off per column on your profile page, and appears
  in the OPDS catalog root. Columns whose values merely contain a dot (Dewey `778.3`) stay flat.

- **More administration screens translated into Swedish.** Swedish speakers now
  see translated administration settings and messages in more places, with 39
  reviewed translations contributed by @yeager.

- **More screens translated into Traditional Chinese (Taiwan).** Traditional
  Chinese (Taiwan) speakers now see translated settings, library actions, and
  device messages in more places, with 1,298 translations contributed by @hug0-l
  in PR #2187. This update also translates the latest original-device actions and
  corrects a Simplified Chinese character and placeholders in draft translations.

- **More of the interface translated into German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish.**
  German translations contributed by @tbnobody in #2246 (wording follow-up in
  #2274), Italian by @luke-70it in #2096 and #2159, Spanish for My Library,
  device management and the admin menu by @HaruIjima-kun in #2109, and Swedish
  device attribution strings by @yeager in #2212.

- **Choose where to resume when a book has several saved reading places.** The
  web reader shows each named browser, Kobo, and configured Storyteller source
  with its own position, freshness, and edition confidence. Previewing another
  source is read-only; choosing “Read from here” starts a new browser position
  without moving the source device.

- **Admins can send a book to another user's eReader from the New UI again.** The classic book page has long let an admin tick another user's eReader in the send dialog, for example to email a book to a friend who doesn't use the app. The New UI's send panel had no way to reach those addresses. It now lists every other user who has an eReader address, as checkboxes under the recipients. Ticking one adds their address to the recipients, and only admins see the list. A book an admin sends only to someone else no longer shows up in the admin's own download history, matching the classic page. Reported by @Glennza1962 (#2296).

- **Administration now has its own always-expanded navigation panel.** Admins
  can move between users, devices, native configuration sections, and classic
  server tools without the library browsing rail getting in the way, while a
  persistent Back to library link returns to the catalog in one step.

- **Scripts and clients can now add or remove up to 200 books from My Library
  in one request.** The batch API applies the same visibility and account
  rules as the existing one-book actions and reports every book separately,
  so allowed books can succeed without hiding which selections were refused.

- **Personal Library accounts can remove several books from their own library at
  once.** Selecting books previously offered only *Delete*, which erases them
  from the global library for every user on the server — one click away from a
  person whose intent was simply to tidy their own shelf. *Remove from my
  library* is now the primary bulk action in Personal Library mode, and the two
  are named for their scope rather than distinguished by colour alone: removal
  takes the books out of your library, your OPDS feed and any regular shelves
  you put them on, keeps your highlights, notes, bookmarks and reading progress,
  and deletes nothing from the global library.

- **Cover designer v2 UI.** The "Design a cover" panel is rebuilt around the v2 design contract: presets move to a proper dropdown (with colour dots and Built-in / Library / My presets groups) plus a Manage-presets dialog (rename, delete, hide and restore built-ins), and a Save-as-preset button sits beside "Use this design"; editing after picking a preset shows an honest "Custom (based on X)" state. Arrangements are selectable thumbnail buttons in a horizontal strip, colour schemes are diagonal split swatches with a "+" rainbow swatch opening a custom four-colour picker, lettering is a row of font-sample cards, and an Advanced disclosure exposes per-slot fonts, sizes and alignment, text templates, and a 2:3-locked cover size. (The matching v2 backend API ships separately; the panel appears once the server serves the v2 catalogue.)

- **Designing a cover now reaches every setting Calibre's own cover generator
  has, instead of three dropdowns.** All five arrangements are offered (Blocks,
  Banner, Ornamental, The Cross and Half and Half, up from three), together with
  Calibre's own four colour themes and ten more; every one of the four colours
  on the cover can be set by hand; and the lettering, its size, its alignment
  and the text of each of the three lines are all yours to choose, with a live
  preview of the result. A stock Calibre cover can now be reproduced exactly.

- **Saved cover designs are yours to add to and remove from.** Save the design
  you are looking at under a name, rename it, reorder your list, and delete what
  you will not use again. An administrator can publish a design to the whole
  library; the designs that ship with Calibre-Web and anybody else's published
  ones can be hidden from your own list and brought back later, so tidying up
  never takes a design away from somebody else.

- **The designer shows you what each choice looks like before you pick it.** The
  catalogue now carries a small rendered sample of every arrangement and of
  every lettering the server can actually draw with, cached on disk so a panel
  with a hundred fonts in it opens at once. Icon and dingbat fonts installed on
  the machine are left out of the lettering list: every typeface offered can
  actually set a title, rather than turning one into a row of little pictures.

- **Design a cover.** Books that arrive without one no longer have to stay a grey placeholder. The
  cover picker gains a "Design a cover" panel that builds a typographic cover from the book's own
  title, series and author: five colour schemes, two lettering styles and three arrangements, with
  named presets and a live preview. Covers are rendered on the server — by Calibre's own cover
  generator where Calibre is installed, and by a built-in renderer otherwise — so the preview and
  the cover that gets saved are the same picture. Personal covers offer the same designs.

- **Automatic covers for coverless imports.** Admin → Basic Configuration gains a default cover
  design, and an opt-in "Design a cover for books that arrive without one" that gives newly imported
  coverless books a real cover during ingest and enforcement. Books that already have a cover are
  never touched.

- **Magic Shelves can now be sorted by the numeric and date custom columns an administrator chooses.** Empty values stay last, tied books keep a stable order across pages, and removed or incompatible columns fall back safely. Credit: @kanjieater (#2086).

- **CWNG shelves now appear as account-scoped KOReader collections.** Shelf
  membership is refreshed on sync without one account or reader overwriting
  another reader's organisation.

- **Your e-readers can now tell the server which books they actually hold.** A device running the NextGen Sync plugin reports its library, and the Devices page shows how many books were in each device's latest report and lets you open the list — with anything the server recognises linked straight to the book, and anything it doesn't marked as not matched to this library. Reports are observations, never instructions: a book missing from a later report is treated as "not seen this time", never as a deletion, so a device that syncs mid-copy or with a card unmounted can't quietly remove anything.

- **Books can be queued to a specific KOReader device from their detail page.**
  The reader collects it on its next sync, in the best format that reader can
  actually open, retries an interrupted transfer without leaving a duplicate
  behind, and skips a book already present in that device's library. A book with
  no format the device can read is refused at the point you queue it, naming the
  formats that were available, rather than failing later on the device.

- **E-readers now report their available storage and can carry out an exact
  “Delete from device” request from the device-library view.** Oversized sends
  are refused cleanly before download, and a missing inventory row never acts
  as a deletion request.

- **Every Global Library card now opens the full book details.** Books outside
  My Library show shared metadata and an Add to my library action without
  exposing reading progress or other membership-only controls. Editors can
  manage the same global metadata from this view under the existing edit and
  delete permission rules.

- **Contributors can ask what a change under `cps/` could affect, and get an
  answer that admits what it cannot see.** A static impact map joins the Python
  call graph to the reconciled Flask route surface, so a file, symbol, or route
  query returns what reaches it and what it reaches, with a confidence on every
  hop. Edges resolved through an import binding are never merged with ones
  guessed from an attribute name, and every call site the analysis could not
  resolve is emitted as data with its location and reason — so the answer to
  "how blind is this about module M?" is a number rather than a shrug. The map
  states its own limits in the same breath: it stops at Python, and roughly a
  third of real changes also touch a template or the frontend, where it has no
  nodes at all.

- **Highlights move between the web reader and KOReader.** A highlight made in
  the web reader reaches KOReader on the words it was made on, and a highlight
  made in KOReader is drawn in the web reader. When the book's text does not match
  where a highlight points, it is left unplaced instead of landing on the wrong
  words (#324).

- **KOReader opens to a CWNG home made for big libraries.** Reading, Recent,
  Shelves, Authors (by surname) and Series, with search that ignores accents; tap
  a cover and the book downloads and opens. A one-page guide covers setting it up
  on a Kindle or any KOReader e-reader.

- **Highlights and notes made on the website or another e-reader appear in the
  book on KOReader.** They are drawn on the words they were made on, a note edited
  elsewhere arrives without being overwritten, and a highlight deleted on the
  e-reader stays deleted.

- **A book sent from the website waits first in Recent** the next time the
  e-reader wakes.

- **A KOReader e-reader shows your whole library as covers and opens any book
  with one tap.** With KOReader sync on, a connected e-reader gets a CWNG
  library folder: every book in its e-reader scope appears in KOReader's cover
  grid, a book that is not on the device yet downloads when it is opened, read
  status follows the book both ways, and shelves marked for e-reader sync become
  KOReader collections.

- **Connect a KOReader e-reader with a short code or a ready-made plugin.** The
  E-readers page shows a code to type on the device (or a link to open from its
  QR code) and approves the device from the website, or offers the plugin as a
  download already set up for your account. Nobody types a password on the
  e-reader.

- **Your Library now opens on Recent: the books you have been reading, newest first, then everything you have not read in the order it was added.** Recency comes from every reader that reports progress — the web reader, a Kobo's sync, KOReader — so picking a book up on one device moves it to the top on the others. It is the first entry in the sort menu, and it is offered on shelves, on author and tag pages and in the Global Library too — all of which keep opening on the order they already did. A sort you have chosen yourself still wins.

- **A "Try My Library" card now welcomes admins on User administration.** One
  click switches every non-Guest account to My Library (each account keeps a
  seeded copy of everything it can see and gains global-library browsing), with
  the previous roles and modes snapshotted first — the **Undo** button is a
  true restore, and each account's selection lies dormant, ready to come back
  exactly as it was. Once enabled, the card can be closed permanently; before
  that it has no close control. The card's state is stored on the server, so it
  is shared by all administrators and survives sessions.

- **Choose a private cover without changing the shared library.** Each user can
  upload a cover, paste a cover URL, or choose one from the cover picker. The
  personal cover appears only in that user's views and e-reader deliveries;
  administrators still control the library cover seen by everyone else.

- **The Highlights button on a book now tells you how many you have.** A book
  you have highlighted shows the count on the button itself, so you can see at a
  glance which books you have notes in without opening each one. A book with no
  highlights looks exactly as it did before — no badge, no zero — and the count
  rides along in the page the book detail view already loads, so opening a book
  is no slower than it was. Thanks to @iroQuai for the suggestion and for
  working through the behaviour of the empty case.

- **The New UI's description box has formatting buttons and a preview again.**
  Editing a book's description in the new interface meant typing raw HTML into a
  plain text box: `<p>` and `<br>` showed through as literal tags, there was no
  way to see how it would look without saving and navigating back, and pasting a
  blurb from Goodreads or Amazon arrived as one unformatted run of text with its
  paragraphs and bullet points gone. The classic interface has had a formatting
  editor there all along, which is why several people said this was the one thing
  keeping them on it. The description field now has bold, italic, headings,
  bulleted and numbered lists, quote, code and links, pasting from a web page
  keeps its structure while dropping the styling junk that comes with it, and an
  "Edit HTML" toggle gives a source view with a live preview underneath for
  anyone who prefers writing the tags. Thanks @mrdynamo for the report, and
  @jsparrowio and @Gauva1n for detailing what each of you was losing (#919).

- **Kobo and KOReader pairing can now be completed from the new E-readers page.** Each account can generate, copy, check, and revoke its private stock-Kobo sync URL; follow device-specific setup steps; and see when a Kobo or KOReader has successfully checked in. The Account page links directly to the pairing flow, so the classic account page is no longer required.

### Changed

- **Whole-book deletion no longer has a redundant heading on book details.**
  “Delete from the global library” now appears directly on the button, while
  the destructive action keeps its quiet separation and accessible context.
  Reported by @chloeroform.

- **Device pages got a visual pass**: the devices list, device detail, admin device board, and device inventory now use grouped rollups, styled status lines, and the shared tab idiom, with relative timestamps and fully translated French/Dutch strings (#1942 M4 follow-up).

- **Every device collection is now server-paged with a capped limit and an exact
  total.** The administrator board computes annotations, positions, authority,
  seed coverage, inventory, and storage in a fixed set of grouped SQL queries;
  its query count no longer grows with the number of users, books, or devices.

- **Inactive Kobo devices report zero current seeded and unseeded books.** Mixed
  seed coverage remains calculated and surfaced across active Kobo devices,
  rather than presenting retired devices as currently unseeded.

- **Device pages recover when their current page disappears.** Removing the
  last item on a page now returns annotations, positions, inventories, user
  devices, and the administrator board to the last page that still exists.

- **Filtered-library outages are explicit.** Missing owners or invalid
  restriction configuration now return a retryable 503 response before any
  device mutation, instead of presenting a successful but misleading empty
  result.

- **Administrator visibility work is candidate-scoped.** The live owner policy
  is evaluated only for books represented by the bounded device page's
  annotations, positions, authority state, or latest inventory report.

- **The "New: My Library" announcement banner is redesigned for readability.** Instead of one long centered line with the icon floating at the screen edge, the notice is now a left-aligned block that lines up with the rest of the page: a small library icon in a tinted chip, the bold title on its own line, and a shorter explanation capped at a comfortable reading width. The message itself is clearer — the shared library still holds every book once, My Library is your own selection, nothing is gone, and every book including new arrivals remains under Global Library in the menu — and the dismiss button stays keyboard-reachable with its server-side "don't show again" behavior unchanged. The same clearer wording now appears in the classic interface, with updated translations for the locales that already had them.

- **Signing in with GitHub, Google or a generic OAuth provider no longer depends on the order the
  server happened to build its login routes in.** Provider sign-in routes are now created fresh for
  each application the server constructs, instead of being reused from a single shared set. On a
  normal single-instance install nothing about signing in looks or behaves differently; the fix
  removes a duplicate-registration failure that appeared as soon as the server built its application
  more than once in one process.

- **"Read now" on a book's detail page opens the EPUB when the book has one.** For a book with both a PDF and an EPUB, it used to open whichever format was added to the library first. It now opens the EPUB, which is also what the caliBlur read icon opens.

- **Reading-status badges can now be hidden from book cards.** Use **Show Reading tags** in Library → View settings; the choice follows your account, while existing accounts keep the badges visible unless you switch them off.

- **Selected View settings radios now use the active theme accent.** Density and row-count choices match the orange controls in the default theme while retaining native keyboard and screen-reader behavior.

- **Classic is now a temporary compatibility fallback instead of a saved browser preference.** The new interface is restored after login, logout, or a new browser session. Existing year-long Classic cookies are removed automatically, and Classic’s “Back to New UI” control still returns immediately.

- **Device administration now fits several useful summaries on one screen.** Each card keeps the device identity, status, last-seen time, reading activity, latest inventory size, and seed progress visible while moving the full diagnostic rollup behind a labelled, accessible details control.

- **The KOReader companion plugin is now `cwngsync.koplugin`, renamed from `cwasync.koplugin`.** KOReader identifies a plugin by its directory name, so this is a real identity change rather than a label: on first start the new plugin copies your existing sync settings over, and your server-side device registration is untouched. Because two copies would both push position and highlight updates for the same book, `cwngsync` refuses to start while a `cwasync.koplugin` is still present — installed, enabled or disabled — and says so, rather than syncing twice. Remove the old directory and restart KOReader.

- **Kobo sync logs now explain every entitlement response without exposing a
  device identifier.** One structured INFO line records the short device hash,
  incoming and outgoing cursors, new, changed, removed, and replay-suppressed
  counts, and why any book already in the device ledger was re-emitted. This
  makes an unexpected download loss diagnosable without a raw traffic capture.
  When the existing private Kobo exchange capture is explicitly enabled,
  library-sync requests now use the same bounded, rotating store as annotation
  exchanges to retain the exact response body and opaque cursors, a hashed
  device label, and a link to those INFO counters.

- **The Library's remembered sort is now saved when you pick one, instead of on every visit.** The old key recorded whatever the page happened to be showing, so it could not tell "I sort by Author" apart from "I have never opened this menu" — which is why a sort you never chose used to be remembered as though you had.

- **The administrator's “Try My Library” card now explains and confirms the
  starting selection before changing every account.** Each account initially
  receives every book it is allowed to see—not only books it has shelved, read,
  or downloaded—and can then curate that complete starting set.

- **The library-mode pair is now named "The global library" vs "My Library"**
  everywhere it appears — the admin user editor, the Account page, the classic
  user pages, confirmation dialogs, and the intro banners — matching the menu
  names the app already uses. French and Dutch translations are complete for
  all new and renamed strings.

- **The Library contents section of User administration is redesigned.** The
  two modes are now selectable cards (the same checked-tint idiom as the
  Account page), and the longer explanation of how switching works sits one tap
  behind an info toggle instead of always occupying the card.

- **The "Set up My Library for all users" header button is removed.** The intro
  card's Try/Undo flow is the one place that bulk action lives.

- **The new interface now opens by default for every browser session and login.** Browsers that cannot run it fall back to Classic for the rest of that session, while command-line, OPDS, Kobo, API, and device clients keep their existing non-redirect behavior. Login deep links are carried through the new login screen, and redirecting there no longer leaves Classic-only login or architecture messages queued to appear later on an unrelated page (#1959).

- **Catalog visibility choices now follow your account.** Discover visibility, hidden-book visibility, and the per-card Read/edit row carry across browsers and devices for signed-in users, while guest browsing keeps the existing browser-local settings.

- **Classic and New UI now both allow deleting a book's final format without
  deleting the book record.** Metadata, shelves, and reading state remain, the
  metadata-only book stays searchable, and a replacement format can be added
  later. Classic no longer silently hides its format-delete controls for a
  single-format book, and both editors explain what the action preserves (#1705).

- **Shelfmark setup now explains personal-library behavior.** Shared-folder imports enter the global library without automatically adding the external requester's My Library selection. The built-in Store / Discover and Anna's Archive acquisition work is not included in this release.

- **The book page keeps four visible buttons; everything else moved into a
  "More actions" menu or the new Files section.** Read now stays the primary
  button beside Favorite and Add to shelf, while read/archive/hide state, both
  send-to routes, Reload metadata from disk, library membership, highlights,
  Edit metadata and Edit cover sit in one accessible dropdown (admins also get
  the "Delete from the global library" section there). Per-format downloads,
  delete, convert and "Add a format" moved from Edit metadata into a Files
  section at the bottom of the book page, and cover changes now happen only in
  the cover editor — opened from the new "Edit cover" pill on the cover itself
  — which gained a "Library cover" / "My own cover" scope switch that absorbed
  the book page's personal-cover controls.

- **The book page leads with its actions, and long descriptions clamp.** Read
  now, Favorite, Add to shelf and the More actions gear moved from below the
  description to the top of the book page — directly under the back link on
  both desktop and mobile — so the primary controls are never buried. A
  description longer than five lines now shows its first five with a soft fade
  and a quiet "Show more" / "Show less" toggle; shorter descriptions render
  whole, with no control at all.

- **Book cards on phones and tablets are just the cover and the title again.**
  The per-card "More actions" (…) button is gone on touch devices: it added a
  control to every cover for three things you can already do by tapping into the
  book — Read now, Edit, and removing it from your library or a shelf (through
  the book page's "Add to shelf" list). Mouse users keep the hover controls
  exactly as they were.

- **Cover editing is clearer and easier to use on phones.** Font previews now show real lettering in a horizontally scrollable row, shared and private cover choices explain who sees each image, and book actions put cover editing, shelves, favorites, personal-library removal, and settings in a predictable order.

- **The browser regression harness now catches six high-value pixel changes on reproducible bytes.** An opt-in Chromium visual lane runs only in an isolated Docker rig, pins its browser and rendering inputs, includes a fully translated French view, and keeps a hard six-snapshot ceiling so visual failures remain actionable. The same update moves Playwright to 1.62.1 and records intermittent E2E failures in a durable flake ledger instead of retrying them away.

### Removed

- **The new interface’s account menu no longer includes a permanent switch to Classic.** Its account, administration, upload, sign-in, and sign-out actions are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **CWA Settings no longer lets one misplaced click erase every CWA setting.**
  Reset All CWA Settings has moved out of Save's primary, rightmost position,
  no longer looks like the main action, and now asks for confirmation that
  names the full loss before changing anything. Both controls can now be
  translated without breaking what the server does. Reported by @iroQuai in
  #1694.

- **Large Kobo libraries no longer stop adding books after the first sync
  page.** New-versus-changed entitlement classification now follows each
  physical Kobo's delivery record instead of comparing unrelated library
  timestamps, and confirmed earlier deliveries remain changes rather than
  being announced as new again. A reader already missing books this way gets
  them on its next sync as new entitlements, without a factory reset or token
  reset. The exception is a book the same account downloaded some other way,
  in a browser or on another Kobo: for that book use **Resend one book to
  this Kobo** or **Force full kobo sync** (#1735).

- **Books with uppercase file extensions are ingested.** The startup scan and
  live watcher now recognize supported formats such as `Book.EPUB` without
  changing case sensitivity for unrelated watcher rules.

- **The multi-select action bar no longer hides books or the metadata form on
  mobile.** While a selection is active, the book list now reserves bottom
  space matching the bar's real height, so the last cover row always scrolls
  clear of it, and the Edit Metadata panel's fields can never be painted over
  by the control that opened them. Reported by @magdalar in #1756.

- **EPUB repair and conversion no longer require manually changing ownership
  under `/root/.config/calibre` in Docker.** Every s6 service that can launch a
  Calibre tool now supplies a writable config directory for the uid that runs
  it. Normal `abc` work uses a plugin-free directory prepared during container
  initialization, root-run maintenance uses a private temporary directory, and
  the existing user-plugin directory remains active only when its explicit
  opt-in is enabled.

- **Kobo users can resend one book to their own device.** The classic account
  page now exposes the existing per-book resend action for the signed-in user,
  while cross-user resend and entitlement-ledger changes remain admin-only.

- **Scrolling large libraries is noticeably smoother.** Newly loaded catalog pages appear immediately instead of staying invisible for most of a second, off-screen covers no longer cost rendering work, and selecting books in a big grid no longer re-renders every card.

- **Smoother scrolling in long annotation lists, faster typing in the author/tag browser, and page turns no longer stutter the reader's progress bar.** Scroll handling re-renders only when the visible window actually moves, large browse pages defer filtering off the keystroke path and skip off-screen render work, and the progress bar animates on the compositor.

- **Hovering the sidebar no longer causes page-wide layout work.** The rail's expand animation is contained to the rail itself while a full transform-based redesign is pending.

- **Large libraries stay responsive while scrolling and opening the sidebar.**
  The catalog now keeps only nearby book rows mounted, and the desktop sidebar
  reveals over a fixed-width rail without shifting or relaying out the library.

- **Login and OIDC callbacks now support reverse-proxy headers with different hop counts.**
  Deployments can configure trusted `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`,
  and `X-Forwarded-Host` depths independently while existing single-count and
  single-proxy configurations keep their current behavior.

- **Book details on mobile put the description first again.** On narrow
  screens the page now reads title, author, description — then the action
  chips, tags and attributes, instead of burying the book's description under
  two screens of controls. Whole-book deletion shrank from a heavy red block
  to a quiet trash icon at the end of the action row (the confirmation dialog
  still guards it), and the action chips themselves are slimmer. The desktop
  layout is unchanged. Reported by @iroQuai in #1828.

- **Highlights made on a Kobo are attributed to that Kobo again, instead of "Unknown device".** When the e-reader uploaded a highlight over its login session without repeating its hardware identifier, the server could not tell which device the highlight came from and stored it unattributed — so the Highlights page labelled it "Unknown device" and it never appeared under the reader that made it. The device's identity is now retained for the length of its login session, and is only ever resolved to an active Kobo belonging to the signed-in user.

- **One failed Kobo KEPUB conversion no longer prevents every later synced book
  from being converted.** The startup backfill now rolls back and replaces a
  failed database session between books, validates rebuilt sessions against the
  real Calibre metadata schema, and stops after three repeated database or
  recovery failures instead of flooding the log for the rest of the library.
  Failed/aborted runs now preserve exact processed/failed counts and remain
  marked incomplete. Reported by @MKos75 and @Tobi.

- **Kobo annotation regressions are now tested against the shapes a real Clara
  writes.** Recovery fixtures use device ContentIDs, typed bookmark rows,
  millisecond creation clocks, selector sentinels, and the matching OEBPS spine
  instead of a server-shaped database that could let incompatible changes pass.

- **The parallel unit suite now tears down Kobo recovery-retention workers
  deterministically.** A retention timer or startup sweep that had already
  begun could outlive its test, contend on shared locks, and reschedule itself
  after the test fixture only cancelled its registered timer. Teardown now
  invalidates that maintenance generation and joins every timer and startup
  thread before the next test starts. Translation-context tests also compile
  into test-owned temporary storage, so a clean run no longer changes how many
  tests execute on the following run (#1868).

- **The Kindle EPUB Fixer's backup of an original file no longer collapses into a single overwritten file** when its `processed_books/fixed_originals` folder does not exist yet. The destination directory is created before the copy, so every retained original is kept under its own name.

- **Bare-metal installs now keep processed-book backups, conversion logs and the metadata write lock under their configured data directory.** Full-library conversion, ingest recovery, EPUB fixing, auto-zipping and duplicate resolution all follow `CALIBRE_DBPATH` instead of trying to read or create Docker's `/config` paths; the affected admin pages show the effective locations too.

- **Importing a Kobo database no longer reports unchanged cloud-delivered
  highlights as newer server conflicts.** Equivalent `NULL` and `-99` KoboSpan
  selector markers are matched before deciding whether recovery data differs,
  while real server edits still report a conflict. Newer device edits preserve
  an existing wire-written `NULL` instead of flipping it to the equivalent
  `-99` representation.

- **Kobo annotation batches no longer acknowledge id-less highlights as stored.**
  A malformed member now makes the batch incomplete while valid highlights in
  the same upload are still preserved, allowing the device to retry safely.

- **LDAP users can log into the new UI.** The SPA login endpoint now authenticates against the configured directory service first, mirroring the classic login flow, including auto-creating directory users on their first sign-in.

- **Generating cover thumbnails for a large library can no longer disappear
  partway through the run.** Each cover now has a bounded processing window, so
  a damaged image or stuck filesystem operation cannot hold the only background
  worker forever. The task continues past isolated cover failures, stops after
  three consecutive timeouts indicate a system-wide problem, and its task
  status and logs now finish with honest generated, skipped, and failed cover
  counts.

- **Large notice banners can be dismissed reliably.** Dismissing hundreds of
  notices now uses bounded batches, and any failure is shown visibly so it can
  be retried instead of appearing to do nothing.

- **Backend concurrency changes can no longer merge behind a frontend-only test gate.** CI now runs the
  full browser suite against the triggering commit's immutable container digest when database-engine or
  concurrent request-handling code changes, instead of accidentally testing the previous `:dev` image.

- **Reverse-proxy SSO no longer opens the Classic login instead of the New UI.**
  The existing app-wide request hook already identifies configured proxy-header
  users on `/app/` and `/api/v1/auth/me`; these deployments now use that working
  SPA path by default. (#1931, reported by @justemu)

- **Adding a book to somebody else's public shelf no longer quietly adds it
  to the curator's own My Library.** The book now joins the shelf owner's My
  Library instead, while smart shelves and shelves without an owner do not
  grant membership to anyone. Refused and already-complete shelf additions no
  longer leave a new My Library membership behind.

- **Server-authoritative Kobo books no longer fall back to a stale cloud
  replacement set.** Seed promotion now proves captured annotation IDs, keeps
  newer server edits and tombstones, serializes reconciliation per book,
  expires abandoned captures, isolates later-device failures, and provides an
  authenticated retry for an initial quarantined seed.

- **New/reset Kobo devices now establish routing evidence before their first
  local annotation response.** Authority lookup failures remain tri-state,
  corrupt capture proof is rebuilt from the complete live set, reconciliation
  uses server-owned row revisions, and post-authority sets over 100 are flagged
  while remaining losslessly available in one complete response.

- **Authoritative annotation GET failures can no longer become destructive
  empty sets or stale Kobo replacements.** CWNG always answers a prior CWNG
  ETag locally, durably snapshots each complete response for exact replay when
  live reads fail, and blocks initial authority while same-ID reconciliation
  conflicts remain unresolved.

- **Fallback snapshots now belong to one exact authority revision.** A local
  Kobo PATCH advances and invalidates the rendered-set digest before its 204;
  stale snapshots are rejected, while a current complete live render is never
  replaced by older bytes if snapshot persistence fails.

- **Owned Kobo PATCHes now commit annotation changes and their authority
  watermark atomically.** Create, edit, delete, and mixed batches roll back as
  one request on failure, remain retryable in the recovery spool, and cannot
  leave an older snapshot eligible after partial persistence.

- **A fresh-download cover reset can no longer overwrite a real cross-device
  position.** Device observations remain independently inspectable, resolved
  progress suppresses only an armed near-cover reset, intentional newer
  backward jumps still reach the resolved row and external progress carriers,
  and status and reading statistics use the newest valid device timestamp.

- **Kobo sync response state is committed atomically.** Shelf tombstones,
  entitlement fingerprints, synced-book markers, and position repair latches
  now share the request's one checked commit, so a failed response remains
  fully retryable.

- **Upgrading no longer prints two alarming `no such column: user.has_own_library`
  warnings on the first start.** On a database created before the per-user library
  feature, the migrations that enable the Duplicates and Favorites sidebar entries
  ran before the column they now load was added, so both were skipped with a
  warning that looks like corruption and is not. They applied correctly on the next
  restart, and on a server that already had those sidebar entries there was nothing
  to apply — but on a server old enough to predate them, the two entries stayed off
  until the next restart. Additive column migrations now run before anything reads
  the user table, which also covers the older cover-preview and interface-font
  columns that were exposed to the same ordering hazard.

- **Dutch: the button that permanently deletes a book for everyone now says so.**
  Dutch used *verwijderen* for both removing a book from your own library
  (reversible, deletes nothing) and deleting it from the shared library
  (irreversible, for every member) — the two differed only by "mijn" versus "de
  globale". The destructive one now reads *Definitief uit de globale bibliotheek
  verwijderen*, restoring the distinction English and French already carry.

- **French: the account setting for keeping your own selection is no longer
  labelled "Sélection propre"**, which reads as "clean selection". It is now
  *Sélection personnelle*.

- **Declared Kobo entitlement payload-schema transitions no longer re-deliver unchanged books or removals.** Replay protection preserves the separate book and archive change clocks, always suppresses byte-identical replays, and delivers same-schema or unproven mismatches; manual merges now advance the Kobo book cursor after adding or replacing a Kobo-visible format, while automatic duplicate merges and conversion recovery advance it after adding one.

- **The new UI now honors the viewer and download roles.** Accounts restricted to viewing no longer see download or edit affordances the server would reject, matching the classic UI's role enforcement.

- **Replacing a cover from the new interface works on your own hidden or
  archived books.** The edit page opened for them, but saving a new cover
  answered "Book not found" — the cover endpoint resolved the book more
  strictly than the page that linked to it.

- **A locked cover can no longer be replaced from the new interface.** Locking
  a cover already stopped the cover picker, the classic editor and the
  automatic metadata fetch from touching it; the new interface's edit page
  overwrote it anyway. It now refuses, the same way the picker does.

- **Kobo library sync no longer closes the shared library database connection
  underneath other requests.** Sync still refreshes its view of books written
  by Calibre desktop or a network-share workflow, but now uses the existing
  non-disposing refresh path. If that refresh cannot complete, the request
  returns a defined service-unavailable response and writes a Kobo-specific
  error to the server log instead of disappearing mid-sync (#1977, #1857).

- **Every commit that lands on the main branch is verified by CI again.** A new push used to cancel the still-queued test run of the previous commit, so under a busy merge rate most main commits were never tested while development images still published from them.

- **Screen readers no longer encounter a nameless hidden delete control on desktop book pages.** The narrow-screen delete button is now only rendered on narrow screens instead of being present but invisible everywhere.

- **Skipped tests are named in CI instead of disappearing into a count.** Fast
  and Docker test logs now list every skipped test and reason, and regressions
  that break first-party modules fail instead of being mistaken for missing
  optional dependencies.

- **Fresh bare-metal installs now create the complete `app.db` settings schema
  before configuring the Calibre library.**

- **The device actions menu closes when you click, tap or press Escape away
  from it.** On the Devices page the "⋮" menu could only be closed by pressing
  the same button again or by choosing "Remove device". Escape now closes it and
  returns focus to the button, and a tap outside dismisses it without activating
  whatever sits underneath. Reported by @iroQuai.

- **A highlight synced from KOReader is now attributed to the device it came
  from.** The Highlights page read only the manual override, never the origin
  the sync recorded, so a freshly synced highlight said "Unknown device" even
  though the server knew better. Assigning one by hand then answered "Assigned
  to Deleted device" — over a write that had succeeded — because the page's
  name lookup was built per book while the dropdown offers every device you
  own. The assignment message can also be dismissed now, instead of leaving
  Undo as the only way out of it. Reported by @iroQuai in #2075.

- **A public shelf now shows its books to everyone who can see it in the classic web view, shelves API, and OPDS.** With per-user libraries (My Library) turned on, a shared shelf listed only the books a viewer already owned, so sharing a shelf with someone surfaced nothing new to them. Its books are now listed regardless of membership, and nothing joins anyone's library just by appearing on a shelf. Language, content, archived, and hidden-book filters still apply, and private shelves are unchanged. Reported by @iroQuai.

- **Hardcover auto-fetch no longer repeats ambiguous work indefinitely.** Each book now has at
  most one pending match-review item, refreshed with the newest candidates instead of duplicated.
  Books whose match was rejected are excluded before Hardcover is searched again, and upgrades
  collapse existing duplicate pending items while preserving reviewed history. Reported by
  @magdalar in #2103.

- **Hardcover's automatic ID crawler can now be turned off on its own.** The Run Schedule on the
  CWA settings page has a `Never (auto-fetch off)` option, so the crawler stops without disabling
  Hardcover reading-progress or annotation sync — previously the only off switch was Enable
  Hardcover Sync, which turned off all three. Reported by @magdalar.

- **An unrecognized Hardcover auto-fetch schedule is now diagnosed instead of silently doing
  nothing.** A stored value the scheduler does not recognize is logged and falls back to the weekly
  default, the Run Schedule control displays that effective weekly fallback, and the settings page
  refuses to persist an unrecognized value in place of the one you already had.

- **A Kobo reader that was plugged into a computer and then unplugged no
  longer loses its downloaded-book state on the next sync.** The server now
  recognizes books it already sent to that same reader even when the reader
  returns an incomplete or reset sync token after the USB connection.

- **Book pages no longer scroll sideways after books are imported.** Internal
  retry-safety data stays out of displayed and editable book identifiers, while
  legitimate long custom identifiers wrap within the page on phones and other
  narrow screens.

- **Native Windows source checkouts no longer fail at startup because `fcntl` is
  unavailable.** Restore, Kobo exchange capture, and Kobo PATCH spool locks share
  a platform helper using POSIX `flock` or Windows `msvcrt` byte-range locks.
  Restore still refuses a lock held by another process. If neither backend is
  available, locking explicitly degrades to a logged no-op; use one app process
  and avoid concurrent restore/service writers on such platforms. Thanks to
  Rol3333 for the Windows 11 / Python 3.11 report (#2168).

- **Adding advanced-search results to a shelf now includes every matching book.** The classic interface keeps results paged while adding books from all pages, including matches beyond the first 60.

- **New UI writes no longer fail with 403 behind upstream TLS termination (#2180).**
  The API Origin guard accepts same-host HTTPS origins when the proxy-derived
  URL is HTTP, while continuing to reject the reverse scheme downgrade and
  foreign hosts. Rejection logs now point to `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` and
  `CWNG_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, with bounded request values. Proxy documentation
  explains the hop count for HAProxy → traefik → container deployments.

- **Highlights made before Calibre-Web recorded what kind of highlight they were no longer stop a book from finishing its sync to your Kobo.** Those older highlights have no saved type, and Calibre-Web was reading that missing information as a disagreement with your Kobo rather than as something it simply did not know yet — so the book was held back for safety and could never finish. Calibre-Web now takes the missing detail from your Kobo, which is the only place it was ever recorded, and the book syncs. A real disagreement, where the two sides genuinely say different things, is still held back.

- **A Kobo highlight follows its text after the book is re-converted.** When a
  book's file changes and the highlight is moved to the new chapter, the device
  is now sent the new location instead of the span the highlight was made on,
  so it appears on the right page after the re-download (#2224).

- **The read icon on a caliBlur book cover no longer opens a reader that cannot show the book.** On a book whose only format is MOBI or AZW3, it opened a new tab with a "Not Found" error, even though the file was fine. Those covers no longer show the read icon, and clicking the middle of the cover opens the book's details like the rest of the cover does. On readable books the icon opens the same format as the detail page's "Read now", and audiobooks still open the player. Reported and first fixed by @splitsec2 (#2249, #2250).

- **Marking a book as read now marks it Read on Hardcover.** With Hardcover sync turned on and your own Hardcover API key set, marking a book read from the book page, the new UI, bulk edit, or the KOReader library plugin adds it to your Hardcover library as Read, or moves it to Read if it's already there. Marking a book unread doesn't change anything on Hardcover. Books that only have a `hardcover-id` (no edition) now also turn Read on Hardcover when a Kobo or KOReader finishes them; before, they stayed on "Currently Reading". Thanks to @ashtakom for the report (#2289).

- **Books open even when checking a synced reading position stalls.** Exact-position validation now has a short deadline and falls back to the synced percentage. Slow location indexing no longer blocks the first page, and a late result respects any page turn you have already made.

- **Books can reopen at the exact saved reading position on plain-HTTP home servers.** Archive validation now works without HTTPS, while keeping the reader responsive and falling back to percentage resume when validation takes too long or the book has changed.

- **Resume at your Kobo reading position in the web reader.** When the synced Kobo location can be matched to the EPUB being opened, the web reader now continues at that exact span instead of approximating it from a percentage. Saved browser positions still receive a resume offer; unavailable locations keep the existing percentage fallback.

- **Continue in the web reader from your other device.** The new web reader opens at the exact synced Kobo span when it can verify the book and resolve the position, with the synced percentage as a fallback. When a device has since superseded a known browser position, a dismissible resume button lets you choose when to continue there. Existing browser bookmarks are preserved. Thanks to @uschi1 for reporting the missing inbound sync in #324.

- **Dutch readers can tell the Compact and Dense library layouts apart.** The
  Library View density picker offers Comfortable, Compact and Dense, but Dutch
  translated both Compact and Dense as "Compact" — so two of the three choices
  were the same word, and picking between them was guesswork. Dense now reads
  "Zeer compact".

- **Failed fulfilment tickets are preserved with useful recovery guidance.** ACSM and LCPL uploads
  now reach the failed backup even when Calibre does not recognize the input format, browser-upload
  sidecars are cleaned up after failed kepub fulfilment, and raw licence files are never retained as
  book formats. Reported by @jakejoh.

- **Image-neutral maintenance commits no longer trigger needless dev container
  rebuilds.** CI now derives image relevance from the Docker build-context
  policy while retaining explicit checks for out-of-context build inputs.

- **“Set up My Library for all users” leaves the public Guest account unchanged.**
  The bulk setup action now migrates only non-anonymous accounts, reports that
  Guest was skipped, and keeps the per-user control available when an
  administrator deliberately wants a curated public library.

- **The Account page's Devices and browsers card is easier to scan and act on.**
  Reading sources now appear as clear rows with a browser or e-reader icon, and
  the three identical links are replaced by one primary "Manage devices and
  browsers" action plus a quieter "Pair a Kobo or KOReader" link, so the
  redundant jump to the browser section is gone. The card also no longer claims
  there is no reading data while it is still loading, and the empty state
  explains when devices and the browser source appear.

  Single annotations use the singular count label.

- **Devices and browsers page** — The Devices and browsers page now matches Account, with clearer e-reader and Browser sections, consistent spacing and actions, readable pairing settings, and correctly singular annotation counts. Long source names fit narrow screens, and pairing steps are numbered. Loading and failed-list states keep the page heading and offer a retry; slow rename and removal requests cannot start overlapping changes, and keyboard focus returns correctly when actions finish or are canceled.

- **Account forms fit on phones.** Paired profile, font and password fields now stack below 600px wide, so dropdowns show their whole value and Safari no longer scrolls the Account page sideways.

- **Clicks just below the one-line Help notice reach the page.** The dismiss button's enlarged target now stays inside the notice.

- **The User administration page lines up again.** "New user" and "Set up My
  Library for all users" now sit together as one right-aligned action group
  instead of scattering across the header (on phones the second button was
  crushed into a one-word-per-line column); the explanatory notes under Library
  contents now align with the option text they describe; and the section's
  separator rule spans the full card width like its neighbors instead of
  starting after the heading. Device administration's header now matches the
  same idiom, and the per-user action buttons share one size.

- **Admin navigation is compact and fully scrollable.** Shorter, single-line
  labels and denser spacing keep the 240px context sidebar easy to scan, while
  short desktop viewports can now scroll all the way to Logs even when a notice
  banner is visible above the page.

- **Keep highlight device selectors reachable.** Highlights and notes now size
  their virtualized rows to the rendered content, including notes, device group
  headers, and selection controls on desktop and touch screens. Long highlights
  no longer overlap the following row or hide their device selector beneath it.
  Large lists still unmount off-screen rows and preserve the visible passage
  when row measurements change.

- **Highlights, notes, bookmarks, and reading progress survive removing a book
  from My Library.** They stay intact and readable from the annotation archive,
  including when the personal library becomes empty and when viewing data by
  e-reader. Re-adding the book resumes from the same retained reading state.

- **Pages no longer fail with a server error for a moment right after the
  server starts.** At startup, the Kobo KEPUB check (on by default) saved its
  progress through the database session that web pages were using at that
  moment. A page, OPDS feed or Kobo sync request that arrived during the save
  could fail with a 500, logged as "This session is in 'prepared' state".
  Background tasks now save through a session of their own. The same fix
  covers the Kobo KEPUB repair, the download record written by auto-send, and
  Send to eReader, which could e-mail the library cover instead of your
  personal cover if a page was saving at the same moment. The KEPUB repair now
  reports a completion marker it could not save as a failure and runs again on
  the next start, instead of claiming success.

- **Catalogue sign-in applies the same pacing to every login type.** Repeated wrong passwords from an OPDS client now slow down the same way whether the server signs people in locally or through LDAP.

- **Concurrent My Library removals can no longer empty an administrator-managed
  account.** The last-book rule is now enforced by the same database statement
  that removes membership, including when app.db uses rollback journaling on a
  network share. Batch removal results also disclose the next-sync Kobo removal
  and preservation of reading data, matching the one-book action.

- **Book pages offer only the shelf changes you can make.** The classic book page's "Remove from shelf" menu listed public shelves to readers without the "Edit public shelves" role, whose removal the server then refused, and it appeared with nothing in it when only another reader's private shelf held the book. It now lists the shelves you can change and is hidden when there are none. In the new UI, the Add to shelf menu and the bulk bar no longer offer a public shelf you made before an admin took that role away, which the server also refuses.

- **A refused bulk removal now says why.** Accounts that cannot browse the
  global library are not allowed to empty their library completely, so
  selecting everything left one book behind and reported only that it "failed".
  The reason is now shown, once, however many books it applies to — and an
  oversized batch reports its limit instead of failing silently.

- **The catalog no longer gets stuck showing one oversized book per row in
  Safari.** A transient browser layout could report one full-width grid column
  even when the available space fit a complete row, causing the catalog to load
  only two books and preserve that incorrect layout. Column measurements now
  have to agree with the grid width, card minimum, and gap before they can
  control pagination.

- **The library grid no longer collapses to one card per row after a hard refresh.** A first-layout race could measure the catalog grid while it had no width; the single resolved track that comes back was accepted as a real one-column layout and stuck. Measurements are now rejected until the grid's own width can actually fit its minimum card, and the grid self-heals within a frame if an early read slipped through.

- **Catalog first-load column regressions are now caught before release.** A
  continuous browser watchdog checks that the rendered grid and the column count
  accepted by virtualization converge on the available-width formula, including
  opt-in Chromium and WebKit runs with deliberately staggered stylesheet and
  JavaScript responses. Grid mutations and resizes timestamp actual healthy/bad
  transitions. Synchronous DOM, CSSOM, declaration, class/dataset, and Typed OM
  hooks evaluate the same healthy/bad invariant predicate immediately before
  and after the browser write; only a truth flip licenses measured time, so
  irrelevant properties and truth-preserving geometry changes cannot turn a
  coincident layout state into a false failure. Bad-to-differently-bad writes
  update diagnostics without splitting the episode. Nested hooks share the
  outer measurement and do no work until the grid exists.
  Asynchronous stylesheet/font/observer notifications remain diagnostic unless
  an exact synchronous state-changing surface brackets them. Measured bad
  durations accumulate across brief flaps without turning healthy stalls into
  failures. Safety-only
  observations remain visible diagnostics but deliberately contribute no
  duration: the small named gap is preferable to inferred or coincident timing
  that can produce both false reds and false greens. Any violation still active
  at settle fails unconditionally.

- **The catalog grid no longer collapses to one book per row in Safari.** The
  windowed catalog now gives each virtual row an explicit copy of the measured
  column layout instead of relying on WebKit to propagate `auto-fill` tracks
  through a CSS subgrid. Chromium and Safari-engine checks now verify the cards'
  rendered row and column positions, not only the healthy parent grid.

- **Back-to-back main updates no longer leave the release train blocked by a
  cancelled image build.** When an unchanged commit cannot alias its required
  ancestor image because that producer was cancelled or failed, CI now builds
  the exact commit and publishes its immutable image tag automatically. Because
  that is a real build rather than a tag copy, it also advances `:dev`, so a
  dev-channel deployment restarts on a commit that would previously have been
  skipped. The image content is unchanged — such a commit touches nothing the
  image is built from.

- **Concurrent book downloads no longer fail during metadata embedding.** Calibre exports coordinate with other library operations, and a failed export serves the original file instead of advertising a missing temporary file. Each download keeps its own unique staged filename so another reader cannot overwrite or delete it. KOReader filename matching uses the filename delivered to the client.

- **Container startup now treats persisted settings and Python import paths as
  explicit trust boundaries.** Ingest timing values read from `cwa.db` are
  validated as non-negative decimal integers before the shell uses them, with
  malformed values falling back to their documented defaults. The web and
  first-run units also ignore `PYTHONPATH` and user-site hooks while retaining
  the image's editable application install, so mounted configuration cannot
  unexpectedly replace the `cps` package that starts.

- **Convert Library actually converts again after an ingest, and a failed conversion is reported as failed.** The ingest processor removes the shared temp conversion directory when it finishes, and Convert Library never recreated it, so every run after the first ingest wrote conversions into a path that did not exist and added nothing to the library. The run still reported each book as converted and imported, because the conversion and import commands could not raise the error their handlers were written to catch. Convert Library now creates that directory itself, recreates it if an ingest removes it mid-run, and reports a non-zero exit from ebook-convert, calibredb or kepubify as a failure, with the tool's own error in the log. (#2251, thanks @splitsec2 for the diagnosis and fix in #2252)

- **Convert Library no longer reports "No books found" on a full library when Calibre prints a warning.** When Calibre's config directory is not writable it prints "No write access to … using a temporary dir instead" into the same output as the book list, and Convert Library gave up on the whole list. It now reads the book list around that warning and keeps the warning in the log, where it points at the config directory to fix. (#1954, thanks @AliceTCrowe for the log that showed it)

- **The cover picker now asks every source for the book's title and author, and tells you when a source refused instead of "No results".**
  It used to search all sources with the book's ISBN alone, which most catalogues and shops cannot resolve for an
  edition they do not stock; on one household library that turned a well-known novel into "1 of 15 sources
  answered". A source that rejects the configured key (Hardcover), runs out of shared quota (Google Books,
  ComicVine) or blocks the request (Amazon) is now labelled as such, with the remedy, in both the cover picker
  and the metadata search. You can also re-run the sources with your own words from the picker's toolbar, and
  the server log carries one line per search naming each source's outcome. Kobo searches with non-ASCII titles
  or authors no longer fail with HTTP 400.

- **Setting a cover no longer fails with "not a valid image file" when the server cannot create files in the book's folder.**
  A folder owned by another user (for example one created by a root process on a network share) blocked every cover
  change since v4.1.43 because the new cover was staged as a sibling file first. When the existing cover itself is
  writable, the server now replaces it in place instead of refusing; when it is not, the error names the folder and
  the user ids involved instead of blaming the image.

- **Pasting an image link into the cover picker no longer fails with "Server returned HTTP 403" on hosts such as Wikimedia, and links copied from Google Images now work.** The
  server identifies itself when it checks and downloads a cover, retries with a normal download when a host refuses the
  quick check, and uses the image behind a Google Images results link instead of the results page. When the check itself
  fails, the reason is shown under the field instead of a silently disabled button.

- **Queued device downloads now recheck the user's current library and content
  restrictions before sending the book.** Removing a book from a user's view
  now revokes an older queued delivery instead of leaving a stale download
  available.

- **Book deletion now reports what actually happened.** Bulk actions count and
  list failed books, leave only those books selected for an immediate retry,
  and distinguish a completed database deletion with incomplete file cleanup
  from a clean success.

- **Device action recovery** — Device management now explains failed rename, removal, and undo requests and keeps the action available to retry. Canceling a removal returns keyboard focus to the device's action button, and the page uses one main landmark for screen readers.

- **Large e-reader libraries no longer load thousands of books into the Devices page at once.**
  Device inventories now load a bounded 200-book window and show how many books are displayed out
  of the complete latest inventory.

- **Fully verified pull requests no longer get blocked by a short SPA test
  dependency-install timeout.** The E2E lane now gives cached frontend and
  Playwright setup enough time to survive registry stalls, avoids optional npm
  network passes, and reuses its installed dependency tree for the SPA overlay.

- **KOReader sync no longer moves a Kobo back to an earlier page.** Progress
  shared between the two readers now preserves the furthest portable position,
  including on a KOReader device's deliberate rewind.

- **Adding a globally visible book to a shelf now adds it to My Library first,
  even outside the new web interface.** The API and classic shelf actions now
  enforce the documented server-side rule. Administrator-managed accounts get
  an actionable permission message instead of an invalid-book error, while a
  genuinely missing book remains a 404.

- **Cover writes are staged and decoded before publication.** A failed write,
  image validation, or metadata commit never touches the existing local or
  Google Drive cover. After a successful metadata commit, local covers publish
  with an atomic rename and existing Drive covers update on the same file ID;
  publication failures trigger metadata compensation.

- **An interrupted cover publication is cleaned up on the next startup.** A
  process death between the metadata commit and cover publication can still
  leave metadata claiming a cover that was not published. On the next startup,
  the orphan stage is logged and removed without guessing whether to publish it.

- **Kobo sync confirmations survive long periods offline.** Returning after
  more than seven days now records the final page as delivered instead of
  sending its books again and risking a Nickel re-download.

- **Factory-reset Kobo devices receive every saved reading position in large
  libraries.** Reading progress and read status now drain through one ordered
  page instead of letting a recently read book skip older pending states.

- **One Browser source per account:** Reading in different browsers or computers now uses the same source. Upgrades consolidate existing browser sources while preserving annotations, notes, shared bookmarks, device assignments, and old source links. Physical e-readers remain separate.

- **Simultaneous reading-position syncs now preserve the furthest real
  bookmark.** KOReader, Kobo, and browser writers now arbitrate each position
  update inside the database, so a delayed lower percentage cannot replace
  newer progress or discard a KOReader locator.

- **Global book details:** Removed books opened through the whole-library catalog no longer show retained reading progress or personal flags. Books still in My Library or actively shared on a public shelf retain their saved state.

- **Global Library books keep their real covers before you add them.** Cover
  images are global metadata, so browsing the archive no longer replaces a
  non-member book's cover with the generic Calibre-Web NextGen card.

- **The New UI now uses your browser's language when you browse as a guest.** With anonymous browsing on, the classic pages already followed the browser's language, but the New UI always showed English. It now follows the browser's language too, falling back to English when the browser asks for a language the server doesn't have. Signed-in accounts still use the language saved in their settings. Reported by @tbnobody (#2247).

- **Opening Hot Books no longer erases other people's download history.**
  The Hot Books page and the OPDS Hot Books feed deleted every account's
  download records for any book the viewer could not see: a book they had
  archived or hidden, or one outside their allowed tags, language, own
  library or OPDS shelves. One look by a restricted account could empty the
  download history of most of the library. The lists now leave those
  records alone and remove only the records of books deleted from the
  library.

- **Hot Books shows full pages and the right page count for accounts that
  cannot see every book, and the OPDS Hot Books feed now has more than one
  page.**

- **Impact-map currency and recall misses are visible in CI.** CI publishes a fresh map, recall report, and currency summary. Stale snapshots and misses caused by source relocation or removal remain advisory. Missing history and generation errors fail the required test summary, but Impact Map failures never authorize an automatic revert. Publication guards protect repository inputs and linked targets, and repeated refreshes invalidate obsolete currency metadata. The committed snapshot retains an eight-hit recall floor while accepting improvements; call accounting is also checked on freshly generated graphs.

- **Automatic ingest protects retries, startup copies, and destructive automerge overwrites.** CWNG hashes a staged snapshot of the persistent source separately from any converted output, then commits the database row and identifier in one Calibre database transaction so nondeterministic conversions cannot duplicate on retry. Calibre's format-file writes are not transactional and may survive a database rollback; before an actual same-format overwrite, the incoming file must pass a bounded sanity check and every at-risk prior format is digest-verified into the bounded `processed_books/overwritten` recovery area. If the helper fails without committing the source marker, CWNG atomically replaces each affected format with its verified recovery copy before retrying. Books imported externally are recognized only when they carry the corresponding CWNG source identifier. Startup candidates require exactly 2.5 s of unchanged size at production defaults.

- **Imported books whose title sort is just their title now file under the right letter.** Many EPUBs carry a "title sort" that repeats the title word for word, and the import kept it as it was, so "The Donkey" sorted under T while "The Barn Door", which carried no title sort at all, sorted under B. When an imported book's title sort is identical to its title and your title-sorting rule would change it, the import now applies the rule. A title sort that differs from the title (a deliberate "Tolkien 01", say) is still kept exactly as the file has it. Books already in your library keep their stored title sort. Reported by @bcsteeve (#2219).

- **The Docker integration suite no longer reports success while skipping 48 of its tests.** The shared API-client fixture signed in without a CSRF token, which the login form rejects, and it treated that rejection as "no test environment available" — so every test needing an authenticated session was quietly skipped while the lane still passed, including the whole KOSync authentication and validation set. The fixture now signs in properly, verifies the session really is authenticated rather than trusting a redirect, and fails loudly when a reachable server refuses the test credentials.

- **Highlights on a book from your Calibre-Web library are no longer lost when your Kobo re-downloads it before that book has finished syncing to Calibre-Web.** Calibre-Web was passing your reader's cached Kobo tag along when it fetched the book's annotations, so Kobo replied "nothing changed" with an empty answer — and your Kobo, which clears a book's highlights during a download and refills them from that answer, was left with none. The same empty answer also stopped the book from ever finishing its sync, so it stayed exposed to the same loss on every later re-download.

- **Kobo annotation uploads and downloads are answered locally only for books whose annotation set Calibre-Web has fully seeded; other books continue through Kobo so partial server data cannot replace device highlights.**

- **Bulk edits now warn when only some selected books were updated instead of
  reporting that everything succeeded.** The warning identifies failed books.
  A book which failed after its files were renamed may now be inconsistent with
  its library database entry.

- **KOReader devices that only push reading progress now appear on the Devices page.** Progress pushes register a device when they include a stable `device_id`; pushes without one still save progress without inventing an identity. Repeat pushes from a device already on the page no longer write to the database every time, and a KOReader device you renamed keeps the name you gave it. As with Kobo, a single account holds at most 20 KOReader identities.

- **Book pages now keep short tag lists fully visible instead of replacing one
  or two tags with a wider Show all button.** Long lists still collapse on
  phones after 8 tags and on wider screens after 20. Reported by @magdalar.

- **Highlights on library-owned books can no longer be replaced by Kobo's
  stale copy when the library lookup fails mid-sync.** Calibre-Web replays its
  current complete snapshot or asks the device to retry instead of forwarding
  a cloud response that may be missing newer highlights and notes.

- **Kobo sync now preserves deletion progress when no archive changes are
  pending.** Empty archive passes no longer reset the reader's deletion cursor
  and make previously consumed tombstones eligible again on alternate syncs.
  A deletion missing from that physical reader's acknowledgment ledger is
  still announced even when its timestamp is behind the reader's cursor.

- **Kobo collection changes are retried when the database is temporarily busy.**
  Creating, renaming, deleting, or changing the books in a collection no longer
  tells the device that the change succeeded after its database write was
  rolled back. Book removals use the same fail-closed acknowledgement rule.

- **Kobo exact resume recovers after a slow conversion.** Completed positions are retained for five minutes, so reopening a book can resume at the exact span even when the first request fell back to a percentage. Requests keep their short deadline and bounded worker admission. Operators can adjust the budget with `CWA_KOBO_RESUME_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default: `0.05` seconds).

- **Kobo reading-position confirmations interrupted by a partial or store sync
  token are now retried.** Books that remain entitled are retried, while an
  entitlement removal cancels the device's pending repair state.

- **Kobo readers keep the server's furthest reading position when a book
  finishes downloading after its reading-state sync.**

- **A Kobo reading position survives the book being re-converted.** A re-converted book renames its chapter files and renumbers the kobo spans, so the reader's saved place pointed at bytes that no longer existed and the device opened the book at the start. The position's prose is now read from the previous book file and found again in the new one (a chapter that merely kept its old file name is not trusted); a position whose previous file is already gone is re-placed at the same fraction of the book. Device latches that moved are re-armed so the Kobo receives the new place after its download.

- **A Kobo keeps the right reading position after its book is re-converted.**
  When the server has moved a reader's position into the new file, the device
  restating its old spot at the same progress no longer overwrites that repair,
  so the next sync sends the reader back to the same prose instead of the old
  anchor.

- **Re-downloading a book on a Kobo no longer wipes its highlights, and a book is no longer re-sent just because the reader downloaded it.** When the KEPUB was built on demand from the stored EPUB, the book's clock advanced and the next sync told the device the book had changed, so it removed and re-fetched the book seconds after the reader had found her place. That materialisation now leaves the clock alone. After any download, the first annotation request from that device is answered from the highlights the server already holds instead of being forwarded to Kobo's empty cloud set, and highlights whose chapter no longer exists in the new file are re-anchored by their text so they still render.

- **The post-download highlight restore on a Kobo now actually engages.** The device fetches the book file without identifying itself, so the download alone could not tell the server which Kobo had just emptied its highlights. The restore is now armed by the sync that re-sends a book the device already holds, the download is attributed to the Kobo that just synced, and an annotation request made while the restore is armed is answered from the server's own highlights whether it arrives before or after the file download.

- **Resending one book to a Kobo no longer disturbs anyone else's Kobo.**
  **Resend one book to this Kobo** marked the book itself as edited, so
  every other account's Kobo that held it received it again as changed
  and downloaded it again. The resend now reaches only the Kobos of the
  account it was made for.

- **Kobo sync summaries now distinguish held books from removal replays.**
  `suppressed_replay` reports every same-reader fingerprint replay kept off the
  wire, while `suppressed_unchanged` reports only the unchanged held-book
  subset. The E2E gate also caches its version-matched Playwright browsers and
  stops a stalled browser installation after three minutes so it can be rerun
  promptly.

- **Picking up a book on your KOReader device after reading it on a Kobo opens at the sentence where you stopped.** Until now the hand-off went by percentage, which in a long book can be several pages away. The server now finds the Kobo's sentence in the EPUB your KOReader device holds, matching it through the book's text because the Kobo's copy is a converted KEPUB with its own file layout. This happens only when the server can prove the match: the Kobo downloaded the library's current KEPUB, the position is the Kobo's latest report, and your KOReader device holds the library's EPUB. Otherwise the hand-off stays a percentage, as before. Which position wins is unchanged: the furthest one.

- **Updating the server no longer tells an existing Kobo that its whole
  library is new.** The first sync after the update used to announce every
  book again, so each reader downloaded its library again and lost its place
  in every book. Each Kobo now keeps the books it already has: on the first
  sync after the update, on the syncs after it, on a sync after the reader
  lost its sync token (as after a USB eject), and when a magic shelf changes.
  This holds for a single Kobo, for several Kobos sharing one account, and
  whichever Kobo syncs first, including one paired after the update. It holds
  for servers updating from v4.1.43 and from older releases, which kept one
  delivery history per account rather than per Kobo.

- **What still arrives, once:** a book added or edited since the reader last
  synced; a book deleted from the library while the reader was away, as a
  removal; and a book an older version sent that nothing ever downloaded.
  That last case covers the books after the first hundred that older
  versions announced in a way an empty Kobo ignores (#1735), and a sync
  whose reply never reached the reader. Those books now arrive as new books.

- **Known limits:**
  - The server records that an account downloaded a book, not which Kobo
    downloaded it. If one Kobo is missing a book that another Kobo on the
    same account, or a browser, downloaded, the update does not send it
    again. Use **Resend one book to this Kobo** on the account page, which
    sends that book again to every Kobo on the account, or **Force full kobo
    sync**, which sends each of them its whole library again.
  - A book is also sent again once if its download records are gone and no
    Kobo ever reported reading it. Until this release, opening **Hot Books**
    deleted every account's download records of the books its viewer could
    not see; the server cannot tell those books from ones a Kobo never
    received, so it sends them rather than risk one never arriving.
  - Three more cases apply only to a server updating from a release older
    than v4.1.43, which kept no delivery record per Kobo. A Kobo whose first
    sync after the update carries no sync position, for example after a
    factory reset or an automatic sync right after a USB eject, receives its
    library again once: the server cannot tell a reader that was reset from
    one that still holds everything. From v4.1.33 or older, the server had
    not recorded its Kobos yet, so a second Kobo on the same account is
    treated as new and receives its library again once. With **only sync
    selected shelves** and more than one Kobo on the account, a book that
    only a magic shelf selects is sent again once.

- **KOReader: books come back when their account does.** An e-reader connected to the wrong CWNG account and then back to the right one used to leave the right account's downloaded and sent books in the folder they were set aside in, so its home showed them only as covers to download again. They now return to the library, with their positions and notes. A folder set aside for someone with the same username on another server is left alone.

- **KOReader: the library home's messages are shown in full.** "No downloaded books here. Choose Show all books in the menu." was cut off after "in the me…" on a Kindle; a message now shrinks to fit instead.

- **KOReader: a failed pairing says what went wrong in plain words.** A Kindle pairing with a slow plain-http server showed "common/Spore/Protocols.lua:85: wantread": the https retry's error, in KOReader's internal terms. It now reports the first attempt's cause ("the server took too long to answer"), calls an https request to a plain http port by that name, and never shows where in KOReader's code an error was raised.

- **KOReader: pairing waits out a slow server for as long as the code lives.** A Kindle gave up after a dozen slow answers ("Lost contact … while waiting for approval") although the code had minutes left, and the approval then arrived for no one. It now keeps asking until the code expires, polls less often when the server asks it to, and says it lost contact only if the server was silent at the end.

- **Switching between KOReader and the web reader opens the same page, not just the same percentage.** When your e-reader holds the same EPUB file the web reader shows, the web reader now opens at the exact place you stopped on the Kindle or other KOReader device, and KOReader opens at the exact place you stopped in the browser. Before, each hand-off went by percentage and could land several pages away. When the device holds a different copy of the book, the hand-off stays a percentage, as before. Which position wins is unchanged: the furthest one.

- **Highlights convert between KOReader and the web reader in many more books.** Chapters whose HTML head leaves tags such as `<meta charset="utf-8">` unclosed, common in calibre-converted and retail EPUBs, no longer stop their highlights from appearing on the other reader.

- **The web reader's reading sources list your KOReader e-readers.** A Kindle or other KOReader device shows where it last was in each book, and can be opened at that exact place when it holds the same file.

- **KOReader: a device moved to another account no longer shows the first account's books.** Connecting an e-reader to a different CWNG account now moves the previous account's downloaded and sent books out of the library folder, with their positions and notes, into a folder named after that account, and says where they went. Their names, which carry the other server's book numbers, can no longer block the new account's books.

- **KOReader: connecting from the menu ends on the library.** The menu the connection started from used to stay on screen, still offering "Connect this device", after the device had connected.

- **KOReader: the pairing screen gives an https server's address with https.** An address shown without it sends a browser to plain http, which an https-only server refuses.

- **Highlights and exact positions now carry between KOReader and the web reader in Project Gutenberg books.** Gutenberg EPUBs, and other books whose chapters are `.html` files with tags written like `<a id="…"/>` or `<div/>`, are read differently by the browser than by KOReader. Until now the server refused to convert positions in those chapters, so highlights did not cross over and hand-offs fell back to a percentage. The server now works out the browser's reading of each such chapter as well, and converts a position when every piece of text lines up between the two readings. If anything is moved or hidden, for example text a table pushes out of place, that chapter keeps falling back as before. This adds the `html5lib` package (MIT license) as a dependency.

- **Opening a book and closing it without reading no longer sends a reading
  position.**

- **Signing in with an app password no longer gets slower as more app passwords
  exist.**

- **A book with a long title in Russian, Chinese or another non-Latin script
  can be sent to an e-reader.** Its file name was cut to 180 letters, which in
  those scripts is more than the 255 bytes an e-reader's file system allows, so
  the device could not save it.

- **The server log no longer says KOReader highlights were lost when they were
  only sent again.** KOReader sends a book's highlights each time it syncs, and
  the ones the server already had were logged as "NOT stored", a warning on
  every book opened. They are now counted as unchanged, and the warning is kept
  for highlights the server really did not store.

- **The fast test lane no longer starts a Docker container for tests that don't need one.** Enabling KOReader sync for the integration suite was applied to a whole module, including a class of pure helper tests, so the quick lane quietly booted a container to run three tests that never touch it. The fast lane now refuses, by name, any quick test that depends on a container.

- **KOReader: an e-reader keeps sending its reading position after another device has saved one.** On a server with a time zone set (for example `TZ=America/New_York`), the position a device pulled carried a time several hours in the future. The KOReader plugin then took that position for a newer one from another device and kept its own to itself, so a Kindle stopped reporting its place for hours after the web reader or a Kobo had saved one. The time is now the moment the position was saved.

- **The KOReader sync setup page is reachable from the new UI.** Its only link
  lived on the classic admin screen, so with the new UI as the default surface a
  KOReader user could reach the e-reader manager — which shows the inventory and
  free-space figures that plugin reports — with no route to the plugin download
  or the install steps. The e-reader page now links to both the KOReader and the
  Kobo setup pages.

- **An unauthenticated sync request now answers "Unauthorized" instead of "Bad Request".** Every KOSync error was reported with HTTP 400, so a request with missing or wrong credentials came back as a malformed request even though its own body said `Unauthorized` — leaving a reader unable to tell "sign in again" from "that request was broken". Authentication failures now use 401, matching what the rest of the sync endpoints already did; every other error is unchanged.

- **LDAP sign-in checks credentials more strictly.** Every sign-in path now applies the same password check before contacting the directory.

- **Reading recorded before this build knew how to timestamp it no longer disappears from Recent.** Positions saved before `bookmark.updated_at` and `kobo_bookmark.created_at` were added carry no clock; they now rank below reading that does, rather than counting as never having read the book.

- **The two reading-position tables are now indexed by how they are read.** `bookmark` carried no index at all and `kobo_bookmark` none on its parent, so every lookup of a saved position scanned the whole table — including the ones the reader makes each time you open a book.

- **Local development state under `local-dev/` can no longer be staged accidentally.** Every new rig directory is ignored by default, while the checked-in compose and emulator source files remain committable.

- **A broken interface language can no longer lock you out of your own
  settings.** The language stored on your account is used on every page, but
  nothing checked it was one the server actually ships — and if a bad value got
  in, the profile page you would use to fix it was the page that stopped
  working. Pages now fall back to a language you can read, and every place the
  setting can be saved checks it first. Regional tags like `pt-BR` are
  understood rather than refused.

- **Smart shelves with rule groups open in the new UI's editor.** A smart shelf built in the classic editor with "Add group" (for example "tag is not X, and tag is A or B") crashed the new UI's edit page with `can't access property "includes"`. The editor now shows each group with its own "all rules / any rule" choice, keeps every group when you save, and can add and remove groups itself. Reported by @vinxa (#2257).

- **Switching accounts in the new interface can no longer show My Library data
  cached for the previous account.** In-place password and magic-link logins now
  hold the new identity back until all account-specific queries and saved
  catalogue pages from the prior session have been cancelled and removed.

- **My Library navigation** — Removed books and the previous whole-library view no longer reappear when returning to a cached catalog. Loaded pages reset coherently after membership changes, including uncertain batch outcomes.

- **Interrupted account setup** — Administrators can see accounts still awaiting setup, retry them, or undo the original operation. Incomplete setup cannot be dismissed as finished.

- **Public-shelf reading** — Shared books offer browser reading, downloads, and the reader's own notes without requiring personal-library membership; reader and download permissions remain enforced.

- **Shelf picker accessibility** — The open picker expands the book actions instead of covering active download links or tags, preserving usable touch targets and Escape focus restoration.

- **Setting up My Library for every account now keeps its original Undo snapshot before changing any account.** Interrupted setup can resume safely after a restart, failed accounts can be retried without reseeding completed selections, and Undo also restores a partially completed setup. Concurrent administrator requests cannot replace or undo a running setup.

- **My Library:** Saved catalog views refresh after a single-book add or removal loses its server response, preventing a committed removal from reappearing when you return to the library.

- **Bookmarks and highlights saved before Calibre-Web recorded their text no longer stop a book from finishing its sync to your Kobo.** Those older entries have no saved text, and Calibre-Web was reading that missing text as a disagreement with your Kobo rather than as something it simply did not have yet — so the book was held back for safety and could never finish. Calibre-Web now takes the text from your Kobo, which is where it was recorded, and the book syncs. If the two genuinely hold different text, the book is still held back and your copy is left untouched.

- **Cover writes are now crash-safe.** Global covers publish only after their
  metadata transaction succeeds. Personal covers publish under an immutable
  version name before the preference transaction points at them, so a failed
  database commit cannot make a committed preference serve different bytes.

- **Personal covers no longer re-download held Kobo books.** Changing the image
  leaves the entitlement fingerprint and device ledger alone, while the
  authenticated cover endpoint and EPUB/KEPUB delivery use the current user's
  image without exposing it to another account.

- **Removing a book from My Library now says what happens on each reader.**
  The confirmation distinguishes Kobo's built-in sync, which removes the book
  on its next sync, from OPDS and KOReader, which keep copies already on the
  device while the book leaves their library and OPDS feed.

- **Polling ingest:** New or replaced books are discovered even when Docker Desktop or a network mount caches directory timestamps. A bounded reconciliation scan prevents files from waiting indefinitely while keeping the lightweight polling optimization between scans.

- **On every page of the new UI, for as long as the "Try the new Help menu"
  notice was on show, an animation was running on the browser's main thread —
  whether or not anything was moving on screen.** The
  small arrow in the "Try the new Help menu" notice at the top of the app is
  nudged back and forth on a loop. Because that nudge was applied to the icon
  drawing itself rather than to a box around it, Chrome cannot hand it to the
  graphics card and has to redraw it in the same place it runs the page — so
  the app recalculated styles about sixty times a second on every screen, for as
  long as the notice was on show. On a phone that is the difference between a
  scroll that stutters and one that does not: measured on a book page at 390px
  with the processor slowed 20x, one 20-second scroll spent 3,251ms of main-thread
  work, 1,169 style recalculations, 22 dropped frames and 125ms of input delay;
  with that one animation switched off it was 399ms, 0 recalculations, 1 dropped
  frame and 12ms. The animation now runs on a wrapper around the icon, where the
  graphics card can take it — it looks exactly the same. The same mistake was
  found and fixed on thirteen more spinning icons (library refresh, Discover
  shuffle, duplicate scan, cover picker, reader, upload), so a page that is
  loading no longer competes with itself for the main thread. The app's shared
  loading spinner already animated a box rather than an icon, so it needed no
  change. Reduced motion is honoured exactly as before, wherever it was
  honoured before. Measurements are from Chrome; the fix
  costs nothing on any other browser.

- **Book and format deletion no longer reports success when cleanup fails.** A
  failed delete now produces an error, while a book whose database row was
  removed but whose files remain returns and displays an explicit warning
  instead of an empty success response.

- **Deleting books in the new interface now follows the same permissions as
  classic Calibre-Web.** Whole-book deletion now requires both “Delete books”
  and “Edit books”. Accounts that have delete permission without edit
  permission will no longer see or be able to use the new interface's single
  or bulk delete controls.

- **The Duplicates sidebar link now appears for the people who can actually use
  it.** Editors can discover the page, while upload-only accounts no longer see
  a link that leads to a permission error. Administrators remain unchanged.

- **Text files can be scrolled with the keyboard again.** The plain-text reader
  puts its content in a scrolling panel, and that panel could not be reached by
  the Tab key — so on Safari, which includes every browser on iPhone and iPad,
  a reader using a keyboard could not move through a long text file at all.
  The panel now takes keyboard focus and shows a focus ring when it does.

- **Font size, line height, margins and theme chosen while reading now stay put at the next chapter in the new UI's reader.** A change applied to the page you were on, but as soon as the reader moved into the next chapter (or back into the previous one) it snapped back to what the book opened with, while the appearance panel still showed your new value. Reported by @futsiang76 (#2254).

- **Footnote markers and other in-book links now stay in the book.** On iPhone
  and iPad Safari, tapping a footnote marker in the browser reader replaced the
  book with the library home page inside the reader. Footnote and endnote
  markers — in either the EPUB 3 (`epub:type="noteref"`) or the DPUB-ARIA
  (`role="doc-noteref"`) vocabulary, and whether the note lives in the same
  document or another one — now open the note in a dismissible panel with a
  "Go to note" action, other in-book links move the reader to their target, and
  external links open in a new tab. Link targets are at least 24 px, so a
  footnote marker is reachable with a thumb. A reader window can no longer be
  handed a page of the app: a format the reader cannot open answers 404 instead
  of redirecting to the library.

- **The new UI reader's table of contents now shows every level of a book's outline, and every entry takes you where it says.** Books with parts, chapters and sections only listed the top level, so a long book could be navigated by part alone. Entries are now indented under their parent, a section entry opens that section's own page rather than the start of its chapter, and books whose contents file sits in a different folder from the rest of the book (common in converted Project Gutenberg books) no longer ignore a click on any entry. Reported by @futsiang76 (#2253).

- **Clear notes consistently in either reader.** Erasing a note in the classic
  reader now saves the same empty note as removing it in the new reader. Your
  highlight stays in place, and the cleared note stays out of displayed notes and
  text exports.

- **Kobo highlights can open in the web reader without changing your book format.** Native chapter paths now resolve correctly for nested EPUB packages and escaped filenames. The reader verifies the saved native location in the file it opened, or uses a unique exact passage when the original EPUB lacks Kobo spans. Existing EPUB reading positions and original Kobo annotation data are preserved. Uncertain locations keep their saved text and show “Location unavailable”.

- **Highlights from different devices remain separate when they cover the same passage.** Choose an entry in the highlights drawer to edit that annotation. Deleting one redraws any remaining highlight at the same location.

- **Browser reading sources are clearly separated from physical e-readers.** Source totals and assigned annotation totals are labeled separately, historical untyped annotations remain accessible, and an unidentified browser source is identified explicitly. A device that has never reported its inventory no longer looks like a device that reported zero books.

- **The classic web reader opens its Annotations tab and jumps to the selected passage on the first click.** Both web interfaces reuse the same browser identity for highlights and reading progress, preventing an extra unidentified source merely from switching interfaces.

- **Selecting text opens highlight controls in Safari in both web readers.** A shared parent-side selection observer handles sandboxed books while keeping embedded book scripts disabled and avoiding duplicate controls in other browsers. Canceling and immediately selecting the same passage again also reopens the controls.

- **Opening a saved highlight or synced reading position lands on the correct page immediately.** Font and spacing are applied before the destination is measured, and selected margins remain consistent when opening chapters or resizing the reader.

- **Every saved highlight and book note has an Edit action in the reader drawer.** Editing works with keyboard and touch even when the passage cannot be located or Safari cannot forward clicks from the book. Removing a standalone note removes its empty row; removing a note attached to a highlight keeps the highlight.

- **Keep your reading passage while changing appearance.** Font, margin, line-height and column changes preserve the passage; appearance sliders no longer turn book pages when used with arrow keys.

- **The Convert Library and EPUB Fixer pages no longer error before their first run.** On an install where either service had never been started, every status poll returned a server error and wrote a traceback to the log. The pages now show that nothing has run yet. If a poll fails, the page says it lost contact and retries instead of silently freezing. The status poll also reads only the end of the run log instead of the whole file, as the cover and metadata enforcement page already did. Reported and first fixed by @TheFactor1 (#2227).

- **Books shared through a public shelf can now be opened, read and downloaded without first adding them to My Library, including managed accounts and OPDS readers using selected shelves.** Public sharing still respects content restrictions and reading/download permissions; private shelves, sending to an e-reader and native device sync remain scoped as before, and the book page keeps library actions such as favorites, shelves and a private cover for books in your library. Someone who edits another account's public shelf can add only books they can open themselves, so a managed account cannot share itself books outside its library.

- **Smart shelves now reflect personal-library additions, removals, mode changes and content restrictions immediately.** Unchanged selections retain their Kobo synchronization timestamp so refreshing a shelf does not resend its books.

- **Shelf counts in the new UI's sidebar stay in step with the shelf.** Archiving, hiding or merging a book left its shelf's count at the old number until the page was reloaded; the count now updates straight away. On v4.1.43 a shelf could also count books that had been deleted outside the app (for example in Calibre desktop), so the badge sat one or more above what the shelf showed until the shelf was opened in the classic UI; the count now includes only books that still exist. Reported by @theSeanO (#2235).

- **New UI Advanced Search no longer hides books on libraries with a Yes/No custom column.** The search sent no value for those columns and the server read the missing value as "No", so every search, even an empty one, only returned books with that flag cleared. An untouched Yes/No column now places no constraint on the results. (#2211)

- **An Advanced Search now survives opening a result, going back, and reloading.** The criteria are kept in the page address, so returning from a book or refreshing the tab re-runs the same search, and the address can be bookmarked. Pressing Search again with the same criteria now asks the server again, so edits made in another tab show up. (#2211)

- **Book covers no longer stay lit after a tap on phones and tablets.** On
  iPhone and iPad, a cover the reader had touched while scrolling, but never
  opened, kept its raised, ring-lit state until the next tap landed elsewhere.
  The cover lift now appears only for a pointer that can hover and for
  keyboard focus.

- **LDAP users can sign into the new interface on their first visit.** Directory accounts are created with the instance's configured defaults, and successful LDAP sign-ins reset the failed-login limits. Incorrect credentials remain rate-limited, and administrators can still disable account creation or password sign-in.

- **Library tiles no longer flash a grey highlight behind a cover you only touched while scrolling on a phone or tablet.** iOS
  paints its tap highlight on every touch that starts on a book tile — including touches that turn into a scroll and never
  open the book — so the grid flickered while browsing. Tiles now opt out of the tap highlight; tapping a tile still opens
  the book, and the keyboard focus ring is unchanged.

- **Turning single sign-on off no longer locks everyone out.** "Disable Standard Login" used to stay in force after the login type was switched back from OAuth, or after the last OAuth provider was turned off, which hid the username/password form and left no way to sign in. The password login is now withheld only while there is an OAuth provider on the login page to use instead, on both the classic and the new login pages. Reported in [discussion #2272](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/discussions/2272) by @lgwapnitsky.

- **Clicking an Account or Help menu that opened on hover now keeps it open.** Clicking again closes it; touch, keyboard, Escape and outside-click dismissal remain supported.

- **Sign out text remains readable in dark and sepia account menus**, including keyboard focus.

- **"Unarchive selected" in the books table only unarchives.** Selected books that were not archived used to become archived; they now stay as they were. The table's archive column had the same problem when set to off.

### Security

- **SPA login, registration, magic-link, and password-reset requests now enforce their declared rate limits.** They were decorated with limits that nothing ever evaluated, so the new UI's auth endpoints accepted unlimited attempts. Successful password logins clear the caller's login buckets so legitimate users are not locked out by earlier attempts, and a breached limit returns a JSON 429 that reveals nothing about whether the account exists.

- **A login bucket is now scoped to one client address plus one normalized username.** Keying on the username alone let anyone lock a named account out of the instance from any address; a malformed username (for example a JSON list) previously raised inside the key function, fell into the fail-open path, and left the endpoint unmetered entirely.

- **Magic-link polling is sized for four full 10-minute sessions per shared address**, and the browser stops with a visible error instead of silently retrying a fatal response — while still retrying genuinely transient ones (network failures, 408, 425, and 5xx).

- **Device-scoped annotation and position reads now re-check the device owner's
  current filtered library at response time.** A later account-library or
  content restriction therefore removes the affected book from device and admin
  views instead of relying on older sync or queue state.

- **Inventory, removal counts, restore counts, and named deletion requests use
  that same live owner view and fail closed when its owner is unavailable.**
  Matched books that become excluded cannot be exposed or queued through these
  endpoints. Unmatched device files remain visible for explicit named deletion
  without being treated as books in the owner's library.

- **Text from inside a book is shown as text on the Convert Library and EPUB Fixer pages.** Both pages inserted the live run log into the page as HTML. The log echoes text from inside the library's books, such as EPUB metadata and converter output, so a crafted book could run script in the admin's session while a run was on screen. The pages now render the log as plain text, and the two status endpoints return JSON rather than HTML.

- **Browser reading and book deletion now follow the same roles in both interfaces.** Viewer-only accounts can read in the new interface without download permission, while download-only accounts can no longer open the browser reader. Permanently deleting a book, deleting one format, or bulk-deleting books now requires both “Delete books” and “Edit books”.

## [v4.1.43] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Kobo no longer shows Download again for books you already have after a sync hiccup.

## [v4.1.42] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- **Runtime data paths can be configured without editing the installation.**
  Packagers can set `CWA_INGEST_FOLDER`, `CWA_CALIBRE_LIBRARY_DIR`, and
  `CWA_TMP_CONVERSION_DIR` from the process environment while existing
  `dirs.json` values remain supported as fallbacks. Requested with
  @chloeroform and @Thovi98 in #1611. Runtime values are normalized and
  validated as non-root, absolute, traversal-free paths before startup services
  use them.

- **New ingest setting: move a misplaced `ComicInfo.xml` to the archive root.**
  The ComicInfo.xml standard requires the file at the root of a `.cbz`; some
  real scan-group releases package it one folder down instead, alongside the
  pages, and every reader we checked (including ComicTagger and Komga) then
  silently gets no metadata from it. Off by default — turn it on in CWA
  Settings and ingest repackages a copy with the file moved to root before
  import, only when it's present but misplaced. Your original download is
  never touched.

### Changed

- **Environment settings now have one complete, drift-checked reference.**
  `examples/.env.example` documents every supported application, service, and test
  variable, and automated tests keep it synchronized with the code. Initiated by
  @Thovi98.

- **The "Delete book" control no longer looks like a page-wide warning.** It
  remains visible to users with delete permission and separate from everyday
  book actions, but now sits in a quiet, clearly labelled region instead of a
  filled danger banner. The existing confirmation is unchanged. Reported via
  the in-app feedback form.

- **Russian translation updated.** 31 previously untranslated strings now have
  Russian text — Kobo two-way sync settings, bulk-action results, and the
  annotations import summary. Contributed by @standhaftsohnsergius.

### Fixed

- **Local-only accounts can now sign in through the classic login form when
  an LDAP directory rejects their credentials.** The fallback accepts only a
  non-empty stored local password hash, so LDAP-imported accounts remain
  passwordless locally. LDAP outages, account-creation failures, and successful
  directory authentication also no longer show a misleading extra "Wrong
  Username or Password" message. Reported by @justemu
  ([#1903](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1903)).

- **Tag view no longer crams 5–6 columns.** The tags browse list now uses the same 300px column floor as the editor view (~4 columns), so tag names have room instead of ellipsis. Contributed by @0x5t4l1n (#1693).

- **An `.acsm` is fulfilled even when Auto-Convert is off.** An Adobe fulfilment ticket only
  reached its Calibre plugin when Auto-Convert was enabled; with the setting off — or with `acsm`
  on the Auto-Convert ignore list — ingest stopped short and printed guidance telling you to
  install a plugin you already had. A ticket is not a book, so the plugin is the only path to one;
  it now runs on every path. Books are unaffected: with Auto-Convert off, a book still imports in
  its original format. Reported by @jakejoh, following @auspex's original report.

- **Bare-metal startup and uploads survive unusable local configuration.** Read-only profile storage and invalid `PUID` or `PGID` values now warn and fall back instead of interrupting use.

- **Remote annotation updates are no longer queued when the matching local database change could not be saved.**

- **Two ingest runs can no longer run at once.**

- **Ingest keeps working after the post-batch follow-up.**

- **Database restores now recover from stale locks and refuse to run while ingest or cover enforcement is active.**

- **Automatic duplicate resolution no longer deletes a book when its reading data could not be moved.** The duplicate remains available and the group is reported as unresolved so it can be retried safely.

- **Annotations imported from a Kobo now retain their original creation time.** Kobo creation timestamps without an explicit offset are interpreted consistently with the device's paired UTC modification timestamps instead of being replaced by the import time.

- **The container healthcheck can no longer freeze the app it is measuring.**
  Database and service probes now run away from gevent's request thread, and a
  normal short-lived `metadata.db` writer lock uses a strictly bounded recent
  known-good result for that database object instead of parking every request;
  using that fallback emits an operator-visible warning. A lock-free corrupt or
  missing DB is degraded immediately; corruption behind a qualifying lock is
  only detected once the lock clears. Stale health can be reused for at most a
  five-minute grace; after that, the lock itself degrades the probe even though
  the database contents remain unknown.
  Longruns explicitly reported `down` are degraded, while the pre-existing
  `unknown` state (no `s6-rc`, timeout, error, or nonzero exit) remains
  non-degrading. Repeated checks retain at most one DB worker and one service
  worker even if filesystem I/O wedges. On slow ARM and virtual-machine hosts,
  HTTPS detection now has a one-second cap before curl's five-second cap, all
  inside Docker's seven-second outer cap, so a dead app still fails fast.
  Reported by
  [@hayvan96](https://github.com/hayvan96) and corroborated by
  [@chloeroform](https://github.com/chloeroform)
  ([#1799](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1799)).

- **Settings-database saves now keep their rollback boundaries without blocking
  unrelated reads or startup work.** Live backups include committed WAL data, and
  `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true` safely retains legacy behavior.

- **Fix issues occurring on bare metal setups.** The `user_profiles.json` file
  is now created by the Python application instead of rc script, and a `chown`
  operation uses the environment variables `PUID` and `PGID` instead of
  `1000:1000`.

- **"Make public" is no longer offered on a shelf you are not allowed to
  share.** Sharing a shelf needs the "Edit public shelves" permission, and the
  server has always refused without it, but the New UI's shelf page showed the
  button to every owner — so clicking it only ever produced *"you are not
  allowed to edit shelves"*. The control is now hidden when the permission is
  absent, matching the classic UI. "Make private" is unaffected. Reported by
  @iroQuai.

## [v4.1.41] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Kobo hardware experiments can now record the complete Reading Services
  exchange instead of relying on request-line access logs.** Operators can use
  a deliberately explicit private-data environment gate to capture the device
  request, the actual filtered request sent to Kobo, Kobo's raw response, and
  the final byte stream returned to the device for `checkforchanges` and
  annotation GET/PATCH calls. Credentials are redacted, records never enter
  ordinary logs or support bundles, and local retention is capped.

### Changed

- **Contributors no longer have to edit the same changelog insertion point in
  every pull request.** Each change now carries an isolated `changelog.d`
  fragment, and release preparation assembles the fragments deterministically.

### Fixed

- **A series added or changed in the library now reaches the Kobo copy of the
  book.** Download-time metadata embedding was removing the EPUB 3 collection
  metadata Kobo firmware reads, even when the stored KEPUB had already been
  corrected. The served KEPUB now carries the current series and index while
  retaining its cover marker, modified timestamp, refinements, and unrelated
  collections. Reported by @bjekel
  ([#1372](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1372)).

- **The small edit pencil under each book cover no longer looks like a dark
  sticker on the light, sepia and high-contrast themes.** It was drawn with the
  palette reserved for controls that sit *on top of* cover artwork — deliberately
  opaque and the same colour whatever theme you use, so it stays readable over any
  image. Since it moved out from over the cover and onto the card itself, that made
  it a near-black disc with a white outline on a pale card. It now uses the same
  quiet surface colours as every other control on the card, in every theme.

- **Pull requests opened before a release no longer fail their changelog CI
  check after that release is tagged.** The guard now considers only releases
  contained in the branch under test, while retaining the committed release
  ledger as a strict fallback when Git tag reachability is unavailable.

- **Cover thumbnails load faster, and the gap widens the bigger your library
  gets.** Every cover request searched the whole thumbnail table instead of
  going straight to the row it wanted, and the book grid asked for each cover
  twice — once for the WebP version and once for the JPEG. Both are fixed, so a
  page of covers now costs a fraction of the database work it used to. Reported
  by @ericsilberberg on Discord, who was running NextGen and stock Calibre-Web
  side by side and noticed pages populating more slowly here
  ([#1571](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1571)).

- **A comic dropped into the ingest folder now keeps the title, series, issue
  number, author and language its `ComicInfo.xml` already carries.** Auto-ingest
  ran a bare `calibredb add` for comic files, which does not read that embedded
  metadata, so a `.cbz`/`.cbr` tagged by ComicTagger, Kapowarr, Mylar3 or a
  well-tagged scene release landed as `<filename>` by `Unknown` — the same
  guesswork an untagged file gets. Uploading the identical file by hand through
  the web UI already read it correctly; ingest now does too. A comic with no
  embedded tags is unaffected. Contributed by

  [#1691](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1691)).

- **Kobo annotation uploads are no longer acknowledged when their JSON shape
  prevents CWNG from addressing the uploaded annotations.** Non-empty
  non-object bodies and non-empty non-list annotation batches now receive a
  temporary failure so the device retains the delta for retry, while legitimate
  empty sync and delete-carrying batches continue normally. Operators running
  the explicit private
  Reading Services diagnostic can also capture the body of a pre-authentication
  401 refusal in a separate, tightly bounded unauthenticated store. Repeated
  attempts for the same unresolved upload now share one protected recovery
  record, preventing one retrying device from exhausting the instance-wide
  spool and denying recovery staging to other users.

- **Kobo annotation recovery copies could be deleted by maintenance meant for a
  different folder.** The background job that expires old recovery records
  looked up which folder to clean when it eventually ran, rather than when it
  was scheduled, so a change in between could point it somewhere else. It now
  carries its target with it.

- **A highlight that fails to save no longer looks saved.** If the database
  rejected the write, the web reader still showed the highlight as created and
  a delete still reported success — the change was gone but nothing said so.
  Those paths now report the failure, and KOReader is told its push did not
  land instead of being acknowledged.

- **Slow storage no longer discards Kobo annotation recovery bodies.** If a
  durable spool write outlasts the request deadline, it now finishes in the
  background, and one following PATCH can also be admitted instead of being
  rejected merely because the first write is still completing.

- **A Kobo annotation upload now has a bounded local recovery record even if
  local processing throws before it can persist the delta.** Before parsing or
  dispatch, CWNG fsyncs the exact raw PATCH body and its new directory entries.
  Blocking storage work runs off the gevent hub behind a 100 ms request
  deadline; on timeout or any storage failure, the PATCH continues without a
  new record. Unresolved records are never evicted to admit a newer body, and
  transactional replacement restores the previous record set if a new write
  fails. Private retention remains bounded even when no new PATCH arrives. The
  device still receives the same explicit failure it does today when nothing
  was stored — recovery is in addition to that refusal, not a replacement for
  it.

- **Bulk actions now report partial failures truthfully.** Delete, read/unread,
  add-to-shelf, and metadata updates count each request separately; failed books
  are reported instead of being included in a false success total, and only
  confirmed deletions are removed from the library cache.

- **Restoring a Kobo backup no longer drops the annotations from most of your
  books.** The recovery importer only understood the chapter identifier that a
  Kobo writes for books whose EPUB keeps its package file at the top level. For
  every other book — the common case — it counted the annotations as
  unreadable and skipped them, so a restore that reported success could bring
  back a fraction of what the backup held. Those annotations now import.

- **Kobo PATCH recovery no longer commits a record after retention scheduling
  has already failed.** Timer admission now happens before the durable spool
  transaction, so a maintenance setup failure leaves the established recovery
  record set unchanged and the annotation PATCH still fails open.

- **Test-suite reliability: concurrent test processes no longer fight over the
  same lock file.** Several maintenance scripts guard themselves with a
  one-at-a-time lock in the system temp directory, which is correct when the app
  runs but meant any second process on the machine — a parallel test worker, a
  second test run, or the app itself — could make unrelated tests report
  failures. Each test process now gets its own temp directory.

## [v4.1.40] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **The desktop sidebar now leaves more room for books without taking navigation
  away.** On mouse-and-keyboard desktops it stays as a narrow icon rail, then
  expands over the page when you hover over it or focus it with the keyboard.
  Touch devices and smaller screens keep the existing menu drawer. Proposed and
  contributed by @chloeroform ([#1019](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1019),
  [#1652](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1652)).

### Fixed

- **After opening a sidebar destination, the expanded desktop navigation could
  stay over the new page and block its left-side controls simply because the
  pointer was still resting over the item that was clicked.** The rail now
  stays collapsed while the pointer travels out toward the page; deliberately
  returning to the rail or focusing it with the keyboard still expands it
  without shifting the page content.

- **The Discover strip no longer changes its books when you return to the
  browser tab.** The earlier app-wide fix stopped most cached pages from
  refreshing on focus, but Discover's random-book request had its own rule and
  still fetched a fresh set. It now keeps the same picks until you deliberately
  shuffle or reload them. Reported by
  [@TangentFoxy](https://github.com/TangentFoxy) and fixed by
  [@chloeroform](https://github.com/chloeroform) ([#1628](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1628),
  [#1653](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1653)).

- **A book now takes you back to the list you opened it from instead of
  dropping you at the library root.** The back link returns to the same author,
  series, tag, publisher, language, rating, format, shelf, magic shelf, or
  discovery view (Hot, Discover, Top rated, Favourites, or Archived), so a
  filtered view no longer has to be rebuilt by hand. A library search also
  returns with its `?q=` query intact. Advanced search is an honest exception:
  `/search` returns to the search page with an empty form, not the previous
  criteria or results, because that page keeps its criteria in component state
  and puts nothing in the URL. The destination survives a reload of the book
  page, but the list's loaded pages and scroll position do not, so it returns at
  the top; a book opened from a deep link with no recorded origin still falls
  back to the library root as before. Opening a book from somewhere that is not
  a list — a notice banner on another page, for example — or going straight
  from one book to another shows “← Library”, because there is no list behind
  it. Reported by @Arjan61 in #666.

- **Smart shelves and other library activity now keep recording statistics when
  source-tree and container installs launch outside the application directory.**
  Those launches could not find the CWA settings database module, which filled
  the log with `No module named 'scripts'` errors and silently dropped activity
  records for smart shelves, searches, shelves, OPDS, Kobo sync, and related
  actions. Reported in
  [#1755](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1755).

- **Profile pictures and update reminders now follow the configured data
  directory instead of assuming every install uses `/config`.** Source and
  bare-metal installs could otherwise read or write the container paths, making
  a saved profile picture disappear from one interface or preventing it from
  updating, and making the once-a-day update reminder forget its state. Both
  files now live wherever the installation's configuration actually lives.
  Reported by [@Thovi98](https://github.com/Thovi98) and fixed by
  [@chloeroform](https://github.com/chloeroform) ([#1556](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1556),
  [#1678](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1678)).

- **A Kobo can no longer erase a book's local highlights when its Calibre-Web
  session expires or an admin has just disabled Kobo sync.** Those transition
  windows, plus alternate spellings of Kobo's `checkforchanges` request, could
  bypass the owned-book filter and tell the device to replace its complete
  local highlight set from the cloud response. Every equivalent request now
  reaches the same ownership containment; owned books receive an empty change
  list, while Kobo-store content continues to proxy normally.

- **Merging duplicate books no longer discards the newest copy of a highlight
  or note when both books carry the same annotation.** The merge always dropped
  the annotation attached to the book being removed, even when that copy held a
  later edit than the one on the book being kept. It now compares the available
  edit times and revision, then preserves the newest complete version and its
  sync state.

- **Deleting KOReader highlights from a heavily annotated book is no longer
  slower the more highlights that book holds.** Removing a handful of
  highlights made the server load every live KOReader highlight in that book
  first, so the work grew with the size of your collection rather than with the
  number of deletions. The server now looks up only the highlights actually
  being removed, in bounded groups. Which highlights get deleted is unchanged,
  and unrelated highlights are untouched.

- **Two people could not find how to delete a book in the new UI and switched
  back to the classic view over it.** Deletion worked, but the edit page had no
  whole-book delete control and the book page buried Delete at the end of a
  wrapping row of ordinary actions. The edit page now puts Delete book beside
  Edit metadata, and the book page gives it its own clearly labelled
  destructive section — the two places people actually look. Both remain
  permission-gated and confirm before deleting. Reported through anonymous
  feedback ([#1046](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1046),
  duplicate [#1037](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1037)).

- **People who had permission to manage someone else's public smart shelf could
  not do so in the new UI.** Its Edit, Duplicate, and Delete controls were all
  hidden unless you owned the shelf, even though the server allows admins to
  edit it, shelf editors to delete it, and any signed-in viewer to duplicate it.
  Each control now follows its own server-provided permission, matching ordinary
  shelves; Kobo sync remains available only to the shelf owner. Reported by
  [@iroQuai](https://github.com/iroQuai) ([#1734](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1734),
  umbrella [#867](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/867)).

- **Pages and API requests no longer fail sporadically with a dropped
  connection or `socket hang up` behind a reverse proxy or in a client that
  pools connections.** The server deliberately closes every HTTP connection
  after its response; it now sends `Connection: close` so HTTP/1.1 clients do
  not return that closing socket to their pool and try to reuse it.

- **The dependency list on the Statistics page now tells you when something is
  actually missing.** The list is built from the packages Calibre-Web NextGen
  declares it needs, but a few of those only apply to certain systems — one is
  Windows-only, another is for older Python versions. On everything else they
  were reported as "not installed", so the page hid every "not installed" row to
  keep them out of sight, and a dependency that was genuinely absent got hidden
  along with them. That only matters if you run from source rather than the
  Docker image, where it is possible to end up short a package after an upgrade:
  the page showed nothing wrong and the app failed later with an import error
  instead. Entries that do not apply to your system are now left out at the
  source, and anything genuinely missing is listed again. Docker users see the
  same list as before, minus two rows that never applied. Packaging work by
  @chloeroform (#1442).

## [v4.1.39] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **A highlight made on a Kobo or in the web reader no longer disappears after
  a KOReader sync.** A KOReader sync could previously either take ownership of
  an existing highlight or mark it deleted directly, so a later sync — or that
  same request — could remove a highlight it did not create. Every KOReader
  delete path now respects where the highlight came from: KOReader can update
  the contents of Kobo and web-reader highlights, but can delete only
  highlights created in KOReader.

- **The New UI shows a "Reading" badge on books you have started, the way the
  classic UI always did.** The green "Read" pill was there, but a book you were
  part-way through looked identical to one you had never opened, so the only way
  to tell was to open its detail page. Every list the New UI serves — the
  library grid, shelves, magic shelves (including the built-in Currently
  Reading shelf), and search results — now carries the same amber "Reading"
  marker the old cover badge used, driven by the same sync state your Kobo and
  KOReader already write. Reported by @magdalar and @JamesHACS (#1702).

- **Highlights now work in the chapters of a book that keeps many chapters in
  one file — the shape almost every Project Gutenberg book has.** A Kobo
  recognises a chapter by the file it lives in, not by a link into the middle of
  a file, so in these books only the first chapter of each file could hold a
  highlight. Everything you highlighted in the rest of the file was saved on the
  device and simply never shown, with the Annotations panel reporting nothing
  there. Books converted, uploaded, or auto-ingested from now on are stored with
  one file per chapter, so highlights attach where you make them. Measured on a
  41-book library, counting the chapters a Kobo could actually attach a highlight
  to: 13 of 1653 before any of this work, 1192 once the existing repair had run,
  and 1584 with chapter splitting on top — so this change is worth about 392 more
  chapters, and 96% of chapters in that library can now hold a highlight. **A book you have already
  highlighted is deliberately left alone** — changing its chapter files would
  stop those highlights showing on your device — unless it was already stored
  chapter-by-chapter, in which case re-uploading or re-converting it keeps the
  same chapter files and your highlights keep working.
- **The notice you get after CWNG repairs a Kobo book now tells you what to do
  about it, in a way that works whichever way your device behaves.** It used to say the app had "repaired a book previously sent to your
  Kobo" and that "older highlights may still need to be recreated" — accurate, but
  it never said the thing that actually helps: sync, then try highlighting again.
  It now leads with that, and adds the fallback for the case where syncing alone
  is not enough — remove the book from the Kobo and let it download again — so the
  advice holds whether or not your device re-downloads a repaired book on its own.
  The version shown on a book's own page also tells you to download the book again
  if you read it somewhere other than a Kobo.
- **Highlight colours synced through the KOReader plugin were wrong, and on a
  black-and-white Kobo every highlight came back yellow.** The plugin used a
  colour table that had blue and green the wrong way round, called Kobo's pink
  "red" (a Kobo cannot store red at all), and had no entry for grey — which is
  the colour a greyscale reader like the Clara BW records for *every* highlight
  you make, so all of them arrived as yellow. The table now matches what the
  device actually stores, measured on hardware, and the server and plugin are
  checked against each other so they cannot drift apart again.
- **Asking your system to reduce motion now stops every spinning icon in the new
  UI, not just some of them.** The app has seven loading spinners; four stopped
  when you turned on "reduce motion" and three kept spinning — including the
  shared one used on more screens than any other, so the same page could show a
  still spinner in one place and a spinning one in another. All seven now follow
  the same rule. Nothing changes if you have not asked for reduced motion.
- **Container updates and restarts no longer spend the entire shutdown grace
  period frozen before being killed.** The ingest watcher installed a graceful
  shutdown handler but then blocked in a foreground polling or filesystem-watch
  pipeline, which prevents Bash from running that handler. This affected both
  network-share installations and the default native-Linux watcher: every stop
  waited for Docker's final forced kill, severing any requests still in flight.
  The watcher now runs as a managed background process group, so the service can
  receive the signal immediately, stop its watcher and cleanup helpers, and let
  the rest of the application finish shutting down normally. Signals arriving
  during the instant a background process is started are held until its process
  group ID has been recorded, so that startup edge cannot leave a watcher behind.
- **The new UI no longer checks with the server for every book cover as you
  scroll, and the book page no longer fetches a 280KB cover to show it at
  postcard size.** Every cover was sent with instructions never to reuse it, so
  scrolling a library asked the server about images the browser already had —
  one round trip per cover, every time, on every page. Covers now carry their
  own version in the address, so your browser reuses the copy it has and fetches
  again once the cover changes. The book page also asks for the resized cover it
  actually displays instead of the full-size original from your library — the
  same picture at as little as a fifth of the bytes — choosing the size that
  matches your screen rather than always sending the biggest one. The app's own
  program files, whose names already change whenever their contents do, are
  cached the same way instead of being re-checked on every load. On a slow or
  metered connection this is the difference between a scroll that stutters and
  one that does not. Two limits worth knowing: the cover savings apply once a
  book's resized covers have been generated — until then, and on a server
  without the image tools to make them, the app keeps checking with the server
  exactly as it did before — and a page that is already open still shows the
  cover it loaded with until it is reopened or refreshed.
- **Replacing a cover now counts as a change to the book, from the new UI and
  from an automatic metadata fetch.** Both updated the image on disk without
  recording that the book had changed, so the classic interface and any page
  already open kept showing the old cover, Kobo devices were never told to
  re-sync it, and nothing asked for the new cover to be written into the
  downloaded book file. Both now queue that last step; it is a background job,
  so it is requested rather than guaranteed.
- **Highlights imported from a Kobo are the colour you actually made them.**
  Every highlight pulled in from a `KoboReader.sqlite` upload arrived yellow on
  a black-and-white reader such as a Clara BW, and on a colour reader the
  greens came in blue and the blues came in green. The device records a
  highlight's colour as a number, and the number-to-colour table this app was
  using did not match what the hardware actually writes: it had no entry at all
  for the shade every greyscale reader uses, so those all fell through to
  yellow, and two of the four it did know were swapped. Highlights now import
  as yellow, pink, blue, green or grey to match the device, and the reader,
  the highlights page, and the Markdown, CSV and JSON exports all show and
  name them correctly, including the pink and grey a Kobo can make but the web
  reader's own palette does not offer. Existing highlights are read correctly
  as they are — nothing in your library is rewritten. One visible change comes
  with that: the classic EPUB reader used to paint a highlight synced from a
  device in the Kobo's own pale ink, because that raw value reached it
  untouched while every other screen showed it yellow. It now paints the shade
  this app uses for that colour everywhere else, so the same highlight looks
  the same wherever you open it. A highlight whose colour the app cannot work
  out is no longer labelled and drawn as yellow: it is shown in a neutral shade
  and, on the highlights page, named as unknown — so a highlight you really did
  make yellow is no longer indistinguishable from one whose colour was lost.
  Adding a note to an imported highlight also works again — saving one on
  a pink or grey highlight used to fail silently, because the note editor sent
  the highlight's colour back with it and the server does not accept those as a
  choice.
- **Active imports no longer incorrectly ask for a manual duplicate scan on
  bare-metal installs or when ingest marker paths are customized.** Both the
  importer and the duplicate index now look for the batch markers in the same
  configured location.
- **Returning to the browser tab no longer refreshes every cached part of the
  app.** Window focus no longer triggers an app-wide burst of server requests,
  reducing unnecessary traffic for low-bandwidth connections while leaving
  live polling, such as the task queue, running normally.
- **Opening the main library no longer downloads a page-sized response it
  cannot use.** The unfiltered catalog asked the API for an entity list it had
  not been given a name for, which the server answered with the full HTML
  library page (~58KB). The app could not parse that as data, so it failed and
  retried. Nothing on screen depended on it. That was unnecessary traffic
  whenever the unfiltered library view loaded, and it is the second half of the
  same bandwidth complaint as the focus-refetch fix above.
- **Highlights made on a Kobo now appear in more books.** When a book's table of
  contents points *into* a chapter file rather than at the file itself —
  `chapter.xhtml#ch1` rather than `chapter.xhtml` — a Kobo files every highlight
  you make in that chapter under a name nothing on the device answers to, so the
  marks are saved and drawn nowhere. Nothing looks wrong and no error appears;
  the highlights simply never show up. On one 212-book library this affected 57
  books. (Those two figures were counted on the library's source EPUBs; a Kobo is
  served the converted copy. The two carry the same table of contents, so the
  counts match, but the repair itself was measured directly and is reported at
  the end of this entry.) Where the anchor sits at the very top of the chapter it points at it
  says nothing the file path does not already say, so conversion now drops it:
  517 such targets across 25 of those books, with every table-of-contents entry
  kept exactly as it was. Books already in your library are repaired on the first
  restart after upgrading, not only newly converted ones — each one is copied and
  hash-checked before it is touched. Measured on the reference instance after this
  shipped: 37 books repaired, every one completed, and no converted copy left
  needing work. Chapter files themselves are left byte-for-byte
  alone, so highlights you already hold keep their positions. In a few books the
  contents page is part of the reading order and so is rewritten too — five of
  the twenty-five here — but only its links change, and it carries none of the
  markers a highlight attaches to. **Highlights you already made in an affected
  book come back, too** — once your reader downloads the repaired book it files
  them under the corrected name and draws them again. Measured on a Kobo Clara BW
  (firmware 4.45.23792): a highlight that matched no chapter on the device before
  the repair matched exactly one after it, and appears on the page. Your reader
  picks the repaired book up the next time it syncs and you open it. One honest
  limit remains: a table of contents that points genuinely into the middle of a
  file — several chapters packed into one document, common in Project Gutenberg
  editions — still needs those files split, which is not part of this change.
- **The log no longer overstates how many books cannot show highlights.** The
  warning added in v4.1.37 counted page-number anchors alongside real chapter
  entries, reporting 12,862 affected targets on a library whose true count is
  1,821, and 516 for one book whose table of contents has 63 chapters. It now
  counts only the entries a Kobo actually derives chapter identity from.

## [v4.1.38] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **A Kobo two-way annotation sync opt-in appears in settings, switched off, and
  deliberately does nothing yet.** Work has started on letting the server hold the
  authoritative copy of your Kobo highlights, so an edit made in the browser could
  reach the device. That is a replace protocol — whatever the server answers becomes
  the reader's entire set for that book — so it is being built in stages behind two
  opt-ins that both default to off. This release adds only the storage and the
  controls: nothing your Kobo receives changes, whether the opt-ins are on or off.
  The setting explains the same thing where it appears, so a new checkbox in your
  settings is not a feature you have missed.

### Fixed

- **A KEPUB the server cannot repair no longer makes every restart scan the
  whole library again.** After upgrading to v4.1.37, a library containing an
  older kepubify file with a missing `kobo.js`, or a book too large for the
  repair safety limit, could leave the server at high CPU with `database is
  locked` errors and a container that kept crashing. The repair pass treated
  “I cannot repair this book” as “the whole job failed”, never recorded that it
  had finished, and started the complete scan again on every restart, forever.
  It now records a book it explicitly refuses once, reports it as
  “unsupported” in the task list rather than as a failed repair, and lets the
  scan finish so it does not return on the next restart. The book itself is
  still not repaired — this does not widen what the server rewrites — and a
  genuine read error, including a flaky network share, is still retried rather
  than permanently skipping a temporarily unreadable book. If the server cannot
  save the completion marker, the task now reports that failure instead of
  silently claiming success before the scan runs again. Reported by @iroQuai in
  #1696, whose workaround was deleting every `.kepub`.

## [v4.1.37] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Your library now tells you when it has repaired a book, and which books were
  affected.** Some KEPUB files were produced with a packaging defect that stops a
  Kobo from holding highlights in them. The defect was fixed for new conversions
  in the last release, but books converted before that stayed broken until
  something happened to re-convert them. The server now repairs those files
  itself and raises a notice naming the books, because there is one part it
  cannot repair: highlights already made in an affected book are stored against
  the broken structure on the device, and no server-side fix can put those back.
  You should know that rather than discover it later. Dismissing a notice
  dismisses that occurrence only — if the same book is affected again, you are
  told again.
- **Clear books off a Kobo that were deleted before the fix for it existed.**
  Hard-deleting a book now tells paired Kobos to archive their copy, but books
  deleted before that shipped are stranded on the device permanently — no amount
  of syncing, re-pairing or a full resync clears them. Upload your device's
  `KoboReader.sqlite` and CWNG lists what is on the reader but no longer in your
  library, so you can pick which to clear. Nothing is sent until you tick it: the
  list starts unchecked, Kobo store samples are excluded outright, and anything
  the server cannot resolve with certainty is left alone. Purchased Kobo books
  can still appear in the list, so read it before you confirm — that is why it
  asks per book rather than deciding for you.

### Fixed

- **Kobo highlights now stay on the device when it syncs — the v4.1.36 fix did
  not work.** A Kobo first asks which books have changed; if that answer names a
  book, the reader downloads its annotation list and replaces every local
  highlight and note with exactly what came back. v4.1.36 refused that download,
  but the Kobo treats a refusal just like an empty list and still deletes
  everything. This release keeps books served by NextGen out of the earlier
  changed-books answer, so the destructive download never starts. New highlights
  and notes still upload normally.
- **Uploading a Readium `.lcpl` licence file no longer fails with “File type
  isn't allowed to be uploaded to this server”.** Installations that already
  accept Adobe `.acsm` tickets inherit `lcpl` in their Upload Format Allowlist
  once, without losing or reordering their current choices; an allowlist that
  does not accept `.acsm` is left exactly as the administrator set it, and
  removing `lcpl` afterward is respected. The ingest watcher now dispatches LCPL
  files for processing without leaving upload sidecars behind. With Auto-Convert
  disabled, ACSM tickets are no longer imported and checksummed as books; they
  are preserved in `processed_books/failed` instead.
- **A book you are reading no longer un-downloads itself from your Kobo over and
  over.** Whichever book in your synced set was modified most recently could be
  re-sent to the reader as "changed" on every single sync, so the Kobo threw away
  the copy it had and downloaded it again — indefinitely, and usually to the book
  you were in the middle of. One household reader fetched the same title six times
  in three days while every other book on the same shelf was fetched once. The
  cause was a comparison between the sync cursor and Calibre's own
  `last_modified` column: Calibre stores that value as text with a `+00:00`
  timezone suffix, the cursor was compared without one, and SQLite compares text
  character by character — so the newest book always looked newer than the marker
  meant to say "already sent". Books whose timestamp had no fractional seconds hit
  the same bug in reverse and could be skipped instead. A book joined the affected
  set whenever metadata or cover enforcement rewrote it, so this got more likely
  the more you used the library. Both comparisons and the ordering they depend on
  are now normalised, so the timestamp's stored format can no longer decide what
  your reader receives.
- **Basic Configuration now saves when you press Enter in a single-line field,
  and "Convert missing KEPUBs now" works again.** Both did the same thing: that
  page was the one settings screen that refused the save it was trying to make,
  so it answered `405 Method Not Allowed` and dropped you on an error page whose
  only link is back to the home page — taking every unsaved edit on the page with
  it. Pressing Enter in a single-line field was enough to trigger it; so was the
  KEPUB button, which meant the conversion never ran. That is awkward on both
  counts, because converting to KEPUB is the usual first suggestion when a Kobo
  is not showing books or holding highlights properly. Both now save through the
  same path as the rest of the page, so you stay on Settings and get the normal
  confirmation.
  Reported by @pahamrick and @roquemore92.
- **The log now warns when a book cannot show highlights on a Kobo.** Some books
  have a table of contents that points partway into a chapter file rather than at
  the file itself. On a Kobo, every highlight made in such a book is stored
  correctly and drawn nowhere — there is no error and nothing looks wrong, the
  marks simply never appear. On one real library this affects 42% of books. After
  a KEPUB is produced, the log now names the book and how many of its navigation
  targets are affected, so the problem is at least visible. This does not fix the
  rendering; that needs a conversion change with a migration story for highlights
  people already hold.
- **The delete warning no longer tells you the wrong thing about your Kobo.**
  It said deleted books would stay on any paired Kobo and that you had to
  archive and sync first. That stopped being true when deletions started sending
  the device an instruction to archive its copy. The warning now describes what
  actually happens, including the honest caveat: the device is told on its next
  sync, and if that instruction cannot be recorded the book may still remain.

- **Covers are now shaped for the Kobo that is actually asking.** The server-side
  cover padding had one aspect setting for the whole instance, so a household with
  two different Kobos had to pick a winner — the other device got covers padded to
  someone else's screen. Every authenticated Kobo request already announces its
  model, and the server already records it, so the padding now follows the device.
  An unrecognised model keeps the configured setting exactly as before.
- **Kobo sync stopped counting formats as books.** With "Produce and prefer KEPUB"
  on, most books hold both an EPUB and a KEPUB, and the full-library sync was
  counting each one separately. Two visible effects: the log line reported a number
  roughly double your library ("changed entries: 3481" on a much smaller shelf), and
  each sync page carried only about half as many books as it should, so the device
  needed twice the round trips to finish. Books were never sent twice — this was
  throughput and reporting, not duplication.

- **Kobo full-library sync now completes for libraries with more than about
  100 pending books.** Large syncs could repeat the same first page forever,
  adding thousands of duplicate entitlements to the reader until the server
  failed. Each completed page now advances the device to the next one, so the
  library drains normally instead of flooding the Kobo.
- **A new Kobo no longer arrives with most of its books unable to hold
  highlights.** The library converts books to Kobo's own format in the
  background, and it tracked that work with a single "done" flag. Pairing a
  device is exactly what adds more books to convert, so the flag said finished
  while the newly-synced books had never been converted at all. On one real
  library, 216 books were synced to a newly-paired Clara and 182 of them had no
  converted copy. Those convert while the device waits, and if a conversion
  fails the Kobo gets a plain EPUB, which cannot reliably hold highlights — so
  this reached people as "highlighting doesn't work on my new Kobo". The
  progress marker now moves with the library instead of latching once.
- **Clearing a series now clears it on the Kobo too.** Setting or changing a
  series already updated both copies of the book; removing one updated only the
  EPUB. The Kobo kept displaying a series you had deleted, with nothing anywhere
  to explain it. (The obvious shortcut — sending Kobo files through the same
  polishing step as EPUBs — is deliberately not used, because it would re-cut
  the internal position markers and move every Kobo reader's saved place in the
  book.)
- **An edit to a highlight is no longer thrown away when the device sends a
  malformed timestamp.** A highlight arriving with an unreadable clock was kept
  if it was new, but an edit to one you already had was silently ignored — the
  changed text, note, colour and location were all discarded with no error. A
  timestamp that is present but unreadable is now treated differently from one
  that is genuinely absent, and the change is applied.
- **A KOReader client can now tell "this book is unknown here" apart from "this
  book has no highlights".** The server answered both with an empty list, which
  is the same ambiguity that has twice destroyed highlights in this project —
  once in each direction. Our own plugin was never at risk, but any other client
  reading that answer had no way to distinguish them.

## [v4.1.36] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **The book page tells you which shelves the book is on again.** The classic
  page has always shown a pill for each one; the new UI only knew about shelf
  membership inside the "Add to shelf" menu, so answering "what shelves is this
  book on?" meant opening a menu and reading it off the checkmarks. The shelves
  are now listed on the page itself, next to the publisher and language, and
  each one links through to that shelf. Adding or removing the book from the
  menu updates the list straight away. Reported by @lguerard.

### Fixed

- **Clearing a series now removes it from Kobo book files (#1372).** Deleting
  a book's series in the library now removes the old series name and index from
  its KEPUB too, including KEPUBs whose navigation document or another asset
  sits above the package directory, where clearing previously failed silently,
  so a Kobo no longer keeps displaying metadata that was cleared.

- **Deleted tags no longer stay behind in the Kobo copy.** Removing one tag
  from a book updated the EPUB, but the KEPUB merged the shorter list with its
  old tags and kept every deleted value. Tags are now replaced from the library
  metadata instead, and clearing a publisher, description or publication date
  now reaches the KEPUB too.

- **Arabic, Hebrew and Farsi titles now read the right way round.** Book titles,
  authors, series names, descriptions and custom column values written in a
  right-to-left script were rendered left-to-right on the book page and on the
  grid and shelf cards, so the text started from the wrong edge and punctuation
  landed on the wrong side. Direction is now detected per field from the text
  itself, so a library with no language metadata set gets it right too, and a
  right-to-left title above a Latin author renders each correctly. The classic
  book page is fixed as well. Reported by @raphaelbahat.

- **Your Kobo no longer loses its highlights when it syncs.** Highlights and
  notes made on a Kobo could vanish after a sync — a problem reporters have been
  chasing upstream since 2022 without a root cause. Every time you open a book
  the Kobo asks the server what annotations exist for it, and we forwarded that
  question to Kobo's own cloud, which has never heard of a book you sideloaded.
  It answered "none", the device believed it, and deleted the highlights it had.
  For a sideloaded book the Kobo is usually the only copy, so they were gone. We
  now decline to answer that question for books we serve rather than passing on
  an answer that isn't true. Measured on real hardware: 88 highlights before a
  sync, 1 uploaded and 87 deleted after it. This also explains the long-standing
  workaround of removing a book from its shelf once synced — that stops the
  sync, so the question is never asked.

- **Highlights made on a Kobo are no longer discarded by the server.** A change
  in v4.1.34 began validating the chapter location that arrives with each
  highlight, and threw the whole highlight away when that location looked
  unfamiliar — losing the text, the note and the colour over a field that is
  only a pointer and can be recomputed. Some Kobo books legitimately report a
  location the check didn't recognise, so on an affected library *every* Kobo
  highlight was dropped. **If you are on v4.1.34 or v4.1.35 and highlight on a
  Kobo, please update.** Highlights are now always kept; only the pointer is set
  aside when it can't be understood, and the same is true of a malformed
  timestamp.

- **Books that silently refused to keep Kobo highlights now work.** Some EPUBs,
  commonly from free ebook sites, point at their table of contents with a path
  that steps outside its own folder. A Kobo doesn't tidy that path up, so it
  ends up with two different names for the same chapter: it saves your highlight
  under one and looks for it under the other. The highlight stays on the device
  forever and is simply never drawn, which is why highlighting appears not to
  work for one particular book while every other book is fine. Conversion to
  Kobo format now tidies those paths, leaving the book's text and its Kobo page
  markers untouched. On the library this was found in, 5 books of 216 were
  affected — and none had ever managed to store a single highlight.

- **Chapter locations containing a redundant `..` are understood rather than
  rejected.** A Kobo can report a chapter as `OPS/../OPS/chapter-17.xml`, which
  plainly means `OPS/chapter-17.xml`. That is now normalised, so those
  highlights land in the right place and appear in the web reader instead of
  being stored without a location.

## [v4.1.35] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **Running it outside Docker no longer means hunting down `cps.py`.** If you
  install Calibre-Web NextGen as a Python package — packaging it for a distro,
  running it under systemd, or just off a checkout — you can now start it with
  `python -m cps`, the ordinary way to start a Python application. Starting it
  by the path to `cps.py` still works and is unchanged, so nothing you have set
  up needs touching. Thanks to @chloeroform.

### Fixed

- **A conversion that never finished no longer blocks the queue.** Converting
  some books, PDFs most often, started and then sat there forever with nothing
  in the log but a line saying the target format did not exist yet. The
  converter writes to two output streams and we only kept reading one of them
  while it ran, so as soon as the other filled up the converter stopped and
  waited for us while we waited for it. Both are now read together. The same
  fault was in the KEPUB conversion path, where a failure also had no error
  text to show, and in the check that reads Calibre's version. Reported by
  @auspex.

- **Typing a tag that already exists now offers that tag first, and Enter adds
  what you actually typed.** Typing "Romance" pre-selected "Paranormal Romance",
  and pressing Enter applied it, because suggestions came back in no particular
  order and the menu always highlighted its first row. On a large library the
  exact match could be missing altogether, since only the first 25 matches are
  shown and nothing put the best one among them. Suggestions are now ordered
  exact match, then values starting with what you typed, then the rest, and no
  suggestion is highlighted until you arrow into the list — so Enter adds your
  text and ArrowDown then Enter takes a suggestion. This also makes it possible
  again to type a value that sits inside an existing one, like adding "foo" when
  "Fools and Jesters" exists. Applies to tags, authors, series and publishers in
  both the new and the classic editor. Reported by @magdalar.

- **Books you just imported now show up at the top of "Newest".** Drop several
  books into the ingest folder at once and most of them landed somewhere in the
  middle of the library instead of at the front, sorted as if they had been
  added years ago. `calibredb` takes a book's "date added" from the file's own
  metadata, which for most EPUBs is its publication date, so a 1998 novel
  imported today was filed under 1998. That was already corrected on the way
  in, but only for the last book of each batch — every other book in the same
  run kept its publication date. All of them are stamped now. Existing books
  keep the dates they have; this applies to imports from here on. Reported by
  @jdaybell, and @Oakwhisper caught that the earlier tie-break fix, while real,
  was not the whole cause.

- **Reading on a Kobo now moves KOReader too.** Read a few chapters on the
  Kobo, open the same book in KOReader or a KOReader-based device, and it
  stayed wherever that device last was. The book page showed the Kobo's
  progress, so it looked like the sync had worked — but nothing ever reached
  the other device, because the Kobo's position was never written to the place
  KOReader pulls from. It is now. As with the web reader, the two sides share a
  percentage rather than an exact spot: a Kobo describes a position inside the
  copy of the file that device holds, which KOReader's engine cannot resolve,
  so it lands near where you stopped. Needs the NextGen Progress Sync plugin on
  the device; older plugins are served nothing rather than a position they
  would mis-seek on. Reported by @IceSentry, and kept honest by @sroebert's
  testing.

- **"Newest" now actually opens on your newest book.** Books that arrived in the
  same batch — an ingest run, a folder import, anything that adds more than one
  book at once — all carry the same "date added", and the library had nothing to
  break that tie with, so it handed them back in whatever order the database
  happened to walk. A shelf of twenty books added together could come out
  backwards, and switching sort and back could reorder them again. Every sort
  now has a definite order all the way down, so a list stays put, pages line up
  instead of repeating or skipping a book, and the newest thing you added is at
  the top. The same fault was in the classic interface, in the OPDS feeds your
  e-reader pulls, in shelves and magic shelves, and in the duplicate finder, and
  it also affected sorting by publication date (where every book with no date
  set ties), by last modified, by series position, and by downloads — all fixed
  together. Reported by @jdaybell.

- **A first start that fails no longer leaves you with a server you can't log
  in to.** If creating the settings database failed on first run, startup went
  on to create an empty one anyway. That empty file looked like an existing
  install on the next boot, so the step that creates your admin account was
  skipped and there was no way in — and no way to retry, because the file now
  existed. The failure is now reported and the empty file is never created, so
  the next start tries again properly.

- **Metadata and cover enforcement no longer stops until the next restart if the
  enforcer is killed.** The enforcer takes a lock so two copies can't run over
  each other, and released it only on a clean exit. If it was killed instead —
  an out-of-memory kill, a `docker stop` that ran out of patience — the lock
  stayed behind and every later run cancelled itself, so edits you made in the
  web interface kept appearing on screen but stopped being written into the book
  files. Nothing said so; the message went to a log. A run now checks whether
  the process that left the lock is still alive and takes over if it isn't, so
  enforcement resumes on its own instead of waiting for a container restart.

## [v4.1.34] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **PDFs open past page one on iPad.** In the new interface a PDF showed its
  first page and nothing else on iPadOS, in both Safari and Firefox, while the
  same book was fine on a Mac, on Android and in the classic interface. The
  reader was handing the file to whatever PDF viewer the browser ships, and on
  iPhone and iPad that viewer only ever draws one page inside an embedded frame.
  PDFs now open in the same viewer the classic interface has always used, which
  draws every page the same way on every browser, and brings PDF text search,
  thumbnails and annotations to the new reader with it. Reported by
  [@chloeroform](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1584)
  ([#1584](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1584)).
- **Errors explain themselves again instead of turning into a blank 500.** Some
  failures replaced their own explanation with `TypeError: '>' not supported
  between instances of ... and 'int'` and took down the page that was handling
  them. Uploading a book with an unwritable ingest folder was the clearest case:
  the app already had the right sentence ready — "Ingest folder is not writable.
  Check your /cwa-book-ingest volume permissions." — but the crash happened while
  writing the log line, so nobody ever saw it and the upload returned a 500. The
  same fault sat on the "reload metadata from disk" failure path and on ingest
  folder creation. Reported by
  [@Thovi98](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1556)
  ([#1556](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1556)).
- **"No results" no longer covers for a metadata source that is throttling you.**
  Searching Get Metadata for the same book twice could find it on the first click
  and not on the second, with nothing changed in between. Goodreads and bol.com
  answer a real no-match with an ordinary empty page, so when they instead refuse
  a repeated request the app was reading that refusal as "this book does not
  exist" and printing "No results for this query" — the two were impossible to
  tell apart. A refused search now says so, and says to wait a minute and try
  again. Two related pieces of bad advice went with it: a refusal from Goodreads
  or bol.com used to suggest setting an API key, which neither one has (Goodreads
  closed its API in 2020, which is exactly why it is scraped), and an ordinary
  "page not found" from a Goodreads book whose id happened to contain 403 was
  misreported as a refusal. Reported by
  [@briffaantoine](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/303)
  ([#303](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/303)).
- **Eight more settings read in Dutch.** Hiding books from a personal library,
  "Convert missing KEPUBs now", syncing Kobo annotations to Hardcover,
  auto-creating users from LDAP, "Important:", "Use a URL" in the cover picker,
  "Starting..." in the cover enforcer, and the EPUB fixer's search box were all
  showing in English on a Dutch interface. Contributed by
  [@VHE1987](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1553)
  ([#1553](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1553)).
- **More of the interface reads in Russian.** Coverage went from 2,618 to 2,719
  translated phrases: 101 phrases that had no Russian at all now have it,
  including the cover and metadata enforcement screens, the notes and highlights
  panel in the reader, assigning books to an e-reader, and the message you get
  when a KEPUB conversion cannot be queued. Contributed by
  [@standhaftsohnsergius](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1554)
  ([#1554](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1554)).
- **Opening one of your highlights no longer loses your place — or marks the book
  finished.** Tapping a highlight in the "Highlights and notes" list jumped the
  book to that passage and then saved *that* as your reading position, so closing
  the book afterwards reopened at the highlight instead of where you had actually
  read to. Worse, the same save reports how far through the book you are, and the
  server treats 99% as finished — so glancing at a highlight near the end of a
  book could mark the whole book read and pass that on to a connected Kobo or
  Hardcover account. Jumping to a highlight is now treated as looking, not
  reading: your place stays put until you turn a page yourself.
- **More of the interface reads in German.** Coverage went from 1,891 to 2,071
  translated phrases: 121 phrases that had no German at all now have it, and 59
  entries that gettext had guessed and marked provisional — provisional entries
  are dropped when the catalogue is compiled, so they were showing in English
  regardless — are now confirmed translations. One of them was **Import**, which
  had been guessed as "Wichtig:" ("Important:"). Contributed by
  [@chaosblog](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1549)
  ([#1549](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1549)).
- **The highlights page admits it holds your notes too.** Notes you write about a
  book — the ones not attached to any particular sentence — have been showing up
  in the highlights list for a while, but the page still called everything a
  highlight: the heading, the empty state, the per-device counts, and what a
  screen reader announced. A book with three highlights and two notes reported
  "5 highlights". It now reads **Highlights and notes** throughout, matching what
  the reader already called it, and the counts say what they are counting.
- **The reader's Black page theme is back, and it is actually black.** The
  classic reader has four page themes; the new UI's reader only ever showed
  three, and anyone who had chosen **Black** was quietly given the dark theme
  instead — a warm near-black — with no way to get back to it. Black is now its
  own choice with a true black page, which is what an OLED screen wants at
  night (#325).
- **The reader remembers whether you want one column or two.** The new UI's
  reader always laid pages out in two columns on a wide screen, even if you had
  chosen a single column in the classic view — the preference was being saved
  and then ignored. Reading appearance now offers **One column** and **Two
  columns**, the page re-flows as soon as you pick, and the choice follows you
  to your next book and your next device (#325).
- **The reader's buttons are big enough to hit on a phone.** Close, contents,
  appearance, highlights and full screen were 34 pixels square in the new UI's
  reader — reachable with a mouse, fiddly with a thumb while turning pages. They
  are now 44, the size Apple and Google both recommend, and the book title
  shortens to make room instead of the buttons shrinking (#325).
- **Typing in the reader no longer loses your place in the box.** Opening a
  panel in the new UI's reader — the contents list, the appearance controls, the
  highlight popover or the note box — put the cursor back at the top of that
  panel every time anything else on the page updated. In the note box the top is
  the close button, so a note you were part-way through writing could quietly
  stop receiving what you typed. The cursor now stays where you put it (#325).

- **Kindle books get their high-resolution cover now, not just print editions.**
  The high-resolution Amazon cover lookup was keyed only on a book's ISBN, and a
  Kindle edition usually has no ISBN at all — it has an ASIN. So the books most
  likely to need a better cover were the ones the lookup could never reach, in
  both places it runs: the upgrade applied to metadata-search results, and the
  standalone "Amazon (high-res)" card in the cover picker, which simply never
  appeared for those books. A stored Amazon identifier is now used as a lookup
  key too, tried after the ISBN so nothing about the existing path changes. This
  also covers books whose ISBN is a 979-prefixed one, which has no ISBN-10 form
  and was previously a dead end. Reported by @briffaantoine with two worked
  examples (#304).
- **The cover picker now tells you where a picture actually came from.** Covers
  offered by Hardcover, Google and the rest get swapped for a higher-resolution
  copy when one exists, and that copy often comes from Amazon or Apple Books —
  but the card kept the name of the provider that supplied the *metadata*, so a
  card reading "Hardcover" could be showing you an Amazon image with nothing on
  screen saying so. Cards now carry a second line naming the image's actual
  source when it differs. Asked by @briffaantoine (#304).
- **Looking at a book's other editions no longer sends a meaningless search to
  every other source.** The editions list is a Hardcover feature and searches by
  a Hardcover id, but that id was being handed to every enabled provider, which
  each searched for it as plain text and came back with nothing — Goodreads in
  particular looked broken because of it. The editions lookup now asks only the
  source that understands it. Reported by @briffaantoine (#303).
- **The reading app's catalog now calls "Discover" by the same name the website
  does — and shows it in your language.** In an OPDS reader the entry was
  labelled "Random Books", while the sidebar, the new interface and the link
  itself all said Discover. Worse, on a German, Khmer or Norwegian server that
  one entry stayed in English while everything around it was translated, because
  the old wording had never been signed off by a translator. It now reads
  Discover, translated, in all 28 languages. Reported by @chloeroform (#1097).
- **"Reload metadata from disk" no longer wipes out details you edited without
  asking first.** It sits in the same row as the download buttons on a book's
  page, so reaching for a download and landing one button over rewrote the
  book's title, author and series from whatever the file itself said — with no
  undo and no warning. It now asks first, naming the book, and does nothing if
  you say no. Reported by @JamesHACS (#1496).
- **Revoking an app password now asks first too.** Found while fixing the
  above: the revoke buttons render as a column of identical trash icons, and a
  misclick cut off whichever device still used that password with no way to get
  it back. It now names the password you are about to revoke.

- **Four small controls are easier to hit**, most noticeably the ☰ menu button
  on phones — the main way you open navigation there, and narrower than the
  minimum size accessibility guidance asks for. They all look exactly the same;
  the area that responds to your finger or pointer around them is bigger. The
  others are **Delete format** on the edit-book page, **Revoke** on an app
  password, and the Kobo/OPDS shelf checkboxes, where the whole row now responds
  rather than just the small square.
- **The notice bar across the top of the page follows your theme.** It was one
  fixed dark-teal band whichever theme you picked, so on **Light** and **Sepia**
  it sat on the page as a near-black slab, and on **High contrast** it ignored
  that theme's stronger borders entirely. It keeps its own teal identity — it is
  meant to look distinct from the rest of the UI — but now comes in a version
  made for each theme. The Ko-fi bar gets the same treatment, and the × that
  dismisses either one is easier to hit.

### Added
- **Sending everyone straight to your single sign-on no longer means giving up
  the password form.** If you run exactly one OAuth provider, Calibre-Web NextGen
  can take people to it the moment they hit the login page. Until now that
  automatic jump was welded to "Disable Standard Login", so switching it on also
  switched off password login for everyone — including you, if the provider ever
  went down. The two are now separate settings: turn on **Start the only OAuth
  provider automatically** under Admin → Security, and the password form stays
  available at `/login?local=1` as a way back in. Off by default, so nothing
  changes until you ask for it. The setting appears on both the classic and the
  new admin pages. Contributed by
  [@lduesing](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1488)
  ([#1488](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1488)).
- **You can search inside a book you're reading.** Open a book, click the new
  search button in the reader toolbar, and type — results show the surrounding
  sentence with your term marked, grouped so you can tell which chapter each one
  is in, and clicking one takes you straight there — without moving the place you
  were reading, so you can look something up and still come back. Neither the old
  reader nor the new one has ever been able to do this. Long books are searched a chapter at
  a time so the page stays responsive, and if a very common word turns up more
  matches than are useful, the list says so rather than quietly showing you part
  of the answer.
- **Highlights made on a Kobo now say which device they came from.** The
  reader's Highlights and notes panel showed a bare internal word like "kobo";
  it now shows the name you gave the device. Highlights with no device recorded
  — everything made before this was tracked — are listed exactly as before, just
  without a label (#325).
- **You can now write a note about a book without highlighting anything first.**
  Notes could only ever be attached to a passage, so there was nowhere to put a
  thought about the book as a whole — "the argument in chapter 3 never lands"
  had to be pinned to a sentence that was not really the point. **Write a note**
  at the top of the reader's Highlights and notes panel opens a blank note, and
  it appears alongside your highlights on the book's Highlights page (#325).

- **The new UI's reader can go full screen.** The classic reader has always had
  a full-screen button; the new one didn't, so on a laptop or tablet you read
  with the browser's chrome eating the top of the page. There's now a
  full-screen control in the reader's top bar. It's hidden on devices that
  can't do it (an iPhone can only full-screen video, not a page) rather than
  shown as a button that does nothing (#325).

- **Your highlights and notes are now listed inside the reader, and you can jump
  straight back to one.** Seeing what you had marked up meant leaving the book
  for the Highlights page and losing your place — the classic reader has had an
  in-reader panel for this all along. The new UI's reader now has a highlighter
  button in the top bar, with a count, opening a drawer that lists every
  highlight in the book with its note. Picking one takes you to that passage.
  Highlights that came from a Kobo or KOReader are listed and labelled too,
  though a few of those have no saved position to jump to (#325).
- **Reporting a problem now fills the report in for you.** Reporting a bug meant
  landing on a blank GitHub form that asked you to type out your version, your
  browser and which page you were on — and if the app had just crashed, the
  error message was gone from the screen by the time you got there. The "Report
  Issue on GitHub" item in the Help menu, and the link on an error page, now
  open a report that already has all of that filled in, including the error
  itself when there is one. Nothing is sent by your library: it writes the
  report in your browser and hands you a link, so you see the whole thing and
  can edit or delete any of it before deciding whether to post it. Your address,
  your library's name, your file paths and your book titles are never included.

- **You can now write a note on a highlight while reading in the browser.**
  Highlighting text in the new UI's reader only ever saved the colour — there
  was nowhere to record *why* you highlighted it, even though notes made on a
  Kobo or in KOReader have always shown up on the book's Highlights page. Select
  a passage and the popup now offers **Add note** alongside the colours; tap a
  highlight you have already made and you can add, edit or remove its note.
  Highlights carrying a note are drawn with a dashed outline so you can pick
  them out at a glance, and tapping one shows the note without opening the
  editor. Notes sync into the same place as everything else, so they appear on
  the Highlights page and in Markdown/CSV/JSON exports (#325).

- **Two new cover fill styles that fill the e-reader frame instead of adding a
  border.** Every existing style pads the cover out to your device's shape,
  which leaves a mirrored, blurred or coloured band down the sides. If you would
  rather see the artwork itself edge to edge, there are now two more options in
  the fill-style dropdown: **Stretch to fill**, which scales the cover to the
  frame and accepts a little distortion, and **Crop to fill**, which keeps the
  proportions honest and trims a strip off the two long edges instead. The six
  original styles are untouched and Edge mirror is still the default, so nothing
  changes unless you pick one. Requested by @mgrimace (#1280).

## [v4.1.33] - 2026-08-08

### Changed

- **On a sign-in-with-your-provider-only server, the login page stops asking
  you to click one button.** If standard login is switched off and exactly one
  OAuth provider is configured, the login page existed only to be clicked
  through — it now starts that provider straight away. Add `?local=1` to the
  login URL if you ever need the plain page back, which is how an admin gets in
  when the provider itself is down. Cancelling at the provider's consent screen
  used to hand your browser straight back to it, over and over; that loop is
  gone too, and it predates this feature. Servers with standard login enabled,
  or with more than one provider, are unchanged. Contributed by

  ([#1411](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1411)).

### Fixed

- **More of the interface reads in Traditional Chinese.** Coverage went from
  619 to 919 translated phrases, and 130 entries that gettext had guessed and
  marked provisional — provisional entries are dropped when the catalogue is
  compiled, so they were showing in English — are now confirmed translations.

  ([#1424](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1424)).

- **Installing outside Docker still lost your settings database, and imports
  died without saying why.** The previous fix moved `app.db` and `dirs.json`
  to the folder you installed into, but `cwa.db` — the one holding your CWA
  settings, import history and enforcement records — kept looking for a
  `/config` folder at the top of your filesystem. If it could write there you
  got a second config directory nothing else reads; if it could not, importing
  a book stopped partway through and the process exited reporting success, so
  nothing in the logs said anything had gone wrong. All three files now resolve
  the same way, a failure to open the database says which path it tried and
  exits non-zero, and adding a missing settings column no longer depends on
  `/config` being writable — that step used to be skipped silently on exactly
  these installs. Docker sets `CALIBRE_DBPATH=/config` explicitly and is
  byte-for-byte unaffected. Follows on from the packaging work reported by
  @Thovi98.

- **Installing outside Docker put your database somewhere the app never
  looks.** On a source install, the setup script wrote `app.db` into a
  `/config` folder it created at the top of your filesystem, while the app
  itself reads its database from the folder you installed into. Nothing said
  anything was wrong; you just got a first-run setup screen and an empty
  library, with the seeded database sitting in a directory nothing opens. The
  two halves now resolve the config folder the same way, so a source install
  keeps its database where the app reads it. `CWA_DIRS_JSON` had the matching
  problem — it moved `dirs.json` for the scripts but not for the app, which
  would have pointed your ingest and your library at two different places —
  and is now honoured by both. Docker installs set these explicitly and are
  byte-for-byte unaffected. Reported by @Thovi98, packaging for YunoHost.

- **First run printed a chown error that was not an error.** Outside the
  container there is no `abc` service account to hand files to, so setup
  reported `chown: invalid user: 'abc:abc'` and a failed-command traceback on
  every run. The files were already owned by the right user. Setup now says it
  is skipping the step and why, and only reports a genuine permission problem.
  Reported by @Thovi98.

- **Installing outside Docker failed on the first setup script.** If you install
  from source rather than pulling the image — a distro package, a systemd unit,
  anything not living at `/app/calibre-web-automated` — `auto_library.py` quit
  with `FileNotFoundError` looking for a starter database under `/app`, a
  directory that only exists inside the container. The file was in your install
  the whole time; the scripts just weren't looking where the code actually was.
  They now work out their own location, so a source install sets itself up
  without patching. The same run then reached a second copy of the problem and
  tried to create your library at `/calibre-library` no matter what
  `dirs.json` said; it now uses the folder you configured. Docker installs
  resolve to exactly the same paths as before and are unaffected. Reported by
  @Thovi98, who packages Calibre-Web NextGen for YunoHost, and follows the
  `cps/` cleanup @chloeroform did in #1438.

- **Upgrading a source install no longer looks like it lost your settings.**
  Earlier builds put the database in a `/config` folder at the very top of the
  filesystem, whatever directory you installed into. Now that setup uses your
  install directory, a machine upgrading from one of those builds has a real
  database in the old place and none in the new one — and setting up a fresh
  empty one there would have left you looking at an empty library with your
  users and books apparently gone. Setup now stops before that happens, tells
  you which database it found, and gives you the one setting that keeps it.
  Nothing is moved or deleted for you, because only you know which copy is the
  one you want. Fresh installs and Docker are unaffected.

- **The container reported itself unhealthy, and the library count showed 0
  books.** A path cleanup landed a reference to a setting the file never
  imported, so the lookup that finds your Calibre library raised an error the
  moment anything called it. Two places call it, and both quietly treat any
  error as "no library": the `/health` endpoint every Docker, Compose and
  Kubernetes setup polls started answering "degraded" forever even though the
  app was serving pages normally, and the book count on the instance rendered
  0. If your orchestration restarts or refuses to roll out on a failing
  healthcheck, that is why. Affects the `:dev` channel only — no published
  release shipped it.

- **The log no longer opens with a warning about rate-limit storage on every
  startup.** Calibre-Web-NextGen serves from a single process, so the
  rate limiter's in-memory counters are shared by everything that reads them
  and are the correct choice here. The limiter library could not tell that
  the choice was deliberate, because the setting was simply left at its
  default, so it warned that the setup was unsuitable for production on each
  boot. The setting is now stated explicitly. Nothing about rate limiting
  changes — login attempts are still capped the same way — the log just stops
  raising a concern that did not apply. Reported by @chloeroform (#1443).

- **The Tags page showed columns of "…" instead of tag names.** The grid was
  sized before the per-row rename and delete buttons existed, so once those
  arrived they took their space out of the tag name itself: in a 1280px-wide
  window the name had 86px of a 244px cell, and 87% of tags were cut off. Rows
  carrying those buttons now get a wider column — three across instead of four
  on a typical desktop — and a long name uses a second line before it
  ellipsizes. Measured on a 152-tag library, names cut off went from 87% to 9%
  on desktop, 41% to 9% at the 720px width in the report, and 32% to 8% on a
  phone. The Authors, Series and Publishers lists keep their current column
  count and gain the same second line; the compact list view is unchanged.

- **A third-party KOReader sync client is no longer left guessing why a book
  looks unsynced.** Positions that exist only as a percentage — the ones the
  web reader and a Kobo produce — are deliberately held back from clients that
  haven't said they can use them, because older plugins would try to jump to a
  position they can't understand and lose your place. The problem was that
  "held back" and "never synced" looked identical from the client's side: an
  empty answer, with nothing naming the setting that would reveal the position.
  The server now says what it is holding and how to ask for it, logs the same
  thing for anyone reading the server log, and the sync protocol documentation
  now covers the parameter and both position formats. Nothing changes for the
  bundled plugin or for anyone syncing today. Reported by @sroebert (#1445),
  who hit this building Crossink and had to read our source to find it.

- **The "help translate this" notice no longer reappears after every update, and
  now works outside Docker.** The app remembered that it had already shown you
  the notice by writing a small file into its own program folder, which gets
  replaced whenever you update — so the reminder came back each time. Outside
  Docker that folder doesn't exist at all, so the note was never saved and the
  reminder never appeared for anyone running from source. It's now kept
  alongside your settings, where it survives updates. Reported by @chloeroform
  (#1447).

- **If your library lives in a sub-folder, NextGen stopped leaving a stray
  `metadata.db` at the top of it.** Something in the startup checked for a
  database at the top level of your library folder, and the act of checking
  created an empty one there. That stray file is what made versions 4.1.20 to
  4.1.31 refuse to start for some people — 4.1.32 already stopped it breaking
  startup, and now it isn't created in the first place. Two other things were
  looking in the same wrong place and now find your real library: the KOReader
  sync checksum job, which had been failing with "no such table: books" on every
  restart, and the reading statistics, which had been reading an empty database
  and reporting nothing. If you already have a stray file, it's safe to delete
  once you're on this version.

- **Installing from source no longer reports the previous version.** A checkout
  or pip install made from the v4.1.31 or v4.1.32 tag identified itself as one
  release older than it was, so the update check kept offering an update that
  was already installed. Docker users were never affected — those images take
  their version from the build, not from this file. Reported by @chloeroform
  (#1437).

- **The interface now reads in Spanish throughout, instead of leaving about
  half of its labels in English.** With the language set to Spanish, the admin
  screens, metadata editing, upload, shelves, the reader and a long tail of task
  and error messages still showed in English. Another 196 phrases were worse
  than untranslated: gettext had guessed them from a similar English sentence and
  marked the guess provisional, and a provisional entry is dropped when the
  catalog is compiled — so those rendered in English while Spanish that said
  something else, sometimes the text of an entirely different string, sat in the
  file waiting for somebody to confirm it. A few outright reversed the meaning of
  the English. Spanish was covering 1,378 of 2,645 phrases and now covers all
  2,645, which makes it the most complete translation the project ships. Wording
  for add, delete, edit, file, email and eReader is now consistent across the
  interface. Contributed by

## [v4.1.32] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Reading in the browser now carries over to KOReader.** Read a few chapters
  in the web reader, then open the same book on your KOReader device and it
  moves to roughly where you stopped, instead of resuming where the device
  itself last was. It lands near the spot rather than exactly on it — the
  browser records a position KOReader's engine cannot resolve, so the two share
  a percentage — and it applies when you open the book, not during a bulk
  library sync. This needs the updated NextGen Progress Sync plugin on the
  device; until you update it, nothing about its behaviour changes. Reported by
  @jrodrigoferreira and kept current by @iroQuai (#1366, #324).

### Changed

- **A sign-in page whose only button is your one provider now just takes you
  there.** If your server runs in OAuth-only mode with standard login switched
  off and exactly one provider switched on, opening the login page showed you a
  page whose sole purpose was to click through to that provider. NextGen now
  starts it for you. Servers that still allow username-and-password sign-in keep
  the normal login page. If the provider is unreachable, or you want the plain
  page back for any reason, add `?local=1` to the login URL. Contributed by
  @lduesing.
  ([#1411](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1411))
- **Cancelling a sign-in at your provider now returns you to the login page
  instead of bouncing you back to the provider forever.** Backing out of the
  provider's consent screen used to hand you straight back to it, with no way
  off the merry-go-round short of clearing cookies. This affected OAuth servers
  before this release too, including ones that never turned on the automatic
  start above.
  ([#1411](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1411))

### Fixed

- **Fixed: the container refused to start on every release since v4.1.20 if a
  leftover `metadata.db` was sitting at the top of your library folder.** The
  log filled up with `no such table: custom_columns` over and over and the app
  never came up; rolling back to v4.1.19 was the only way out. NextGen picks
  your library by looking for `metadata.db`, and it had started trusting the
  first file with that name — so an empty or leftover one at the root of
  `/calibre-library` was mounted as your library and hid the real one in the
  folder below it. It now checks that a file is genuinely a Calibre database
  before mounting it, says in the log which file it skipped and why, and keeps
  looking. If nothing usable turns up at all it stops with an explanation
  instead of looping, and never writes over the files it found. Reported by
  @sammiq.
  ([#1428](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1428))

## [v4.1.31] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **You can now re-apply covers and metadata to your whole library from the
  admin page, instead of a shell.** NextGen writes your edits into the ebook
  files themselves, but only for the book you just edited — so anything changed
  before a fix, or imported with bad metadata, kept the old values inside the
  file even though the web page looked right. The only way to sweep the whole
  library was a `docker exec` command that isn't in the docs. There's now a
  **NextGen Cover & Metadata Enforcement** page, linked from the admin page next
  to the EPUB Fixer, with a Start button, a live progress bar and log, a Cancel
  button, and an archive of previous runs — the same shape as the convert and
  EPUB-fixer pages. This is what you want after updating to v4.1.30, which
  taught NextGen to write `.kepub` files: a single pass backfills every book you
  sent to a Kobo before that release, so your series and tags finally show up on
  the device. Reported by @stripeymonkey.
  ([#1408](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1408))

- **Your Kobo now gets books in Kobo's own format, automatically.** Kobo devices
  read two kinds of EPUB: a plain one, and a "kepub" that Kobo's own store always
  sends. The kepub is the one the device is built for — faster page turns,
  working chapter progress, and highlights and annotations that actually stick.
  Until now NextGen only made a kepub the first time a device asked for a
  particular book, so most of your library sat in the plain format. There's now a
  **Produce and prefer KEPUB for Kobo delivery** switch in Settings → Kobo, **on
  by default** — on a fresh install and when you update to this version — and it
  makes the kepub ahead of time for every book you've already sent to a Kobo, so
  it's ready before the device asks. EPUB stays the source format and nothing is
  replaced; the kepub is an extra file about the same size, so expect the books
  you sync to your Kobo to take roughly twice the disk they do now. Turn the
  switch off and you get the old behaviour. If kepubify isn't installed the
  switch tells you so instead of silently doing nothing.

- **You can turn off the "Read now" and edit buttons on book covers.** If you
  read on an ereader, the "Read now" link on every cover is just noise, and on a
  touchscreen both it and the edit pencil stay visible all the time rather than
  appearing on hover — which made the library look busy. There's now a **Show
  Read now and edit buttons** switch in the library's View settings (the gear
  next to the sort control). Turn it off and the buttons come off every book
  cover, everywhere they appear: the library, shelves, smart shelves, search
  results, Discover and "More by this author". Both actions are still on the
  book's own page, which is what the cover has always linked to. The setting is
  remembered in your browser and is on by default, so nothing changes unless you
  ask it to. Thanks to @Glennza1962 for the request and @chloeroform for the
  detail about how the classic view handled this.

### Changed

- **Metadata working files moved onto your `/config` volume.** The change logs
  and scratch space the cover/metadata enforcer uses used to live inside the
  application folder, which is replaced wholesale every time you pull a new
  image. They now sit alongside the rest of your per-install state, so an edit
  saved moments before an upgrade still gets applied to the book file after it.
  Anything left in the old location is moved across automatically on first
  start; there is nothing to do. Thanks to @chloeroform for the patch.

### Fixed

- **Running the container as a non-root user gave you a container that said it
  was fine and served nothing.** If you start NextGen with `--user`, or under
  rootless Podman with `--userns=keep-id`, every service died the moment it
  tried to switch to its own app user — something an unprivileged process isn't
  allowed to do. The supervisor restarted them forever, so `docker ps` showed
  the container **Up** while nothing was listening on the port and the log
  filled with `Operation not permitted`. NextGen now checks whether it can
  switch users before trying, and stays as whoever you started it as when it
  can't. It also stops trying to take ownership of your files in that mode,
  which produced most of those errors, and says once in the log why. Running
  normally is unchanged. Diagnosed down to the call sites by @KucharczykL, from
  nine days of running it under rootless Podman.
  ([#947](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/947))

- **"Source Code" in the package details opened a list of downloads instead of
  the code.** If you inspect the installed package — `pip show`, a package
  index, the dependency view — its Source Code link pointed at the releases
  page, which is already what the Release Management link is for. It now opens
  the repository. The same details block used to send you to the upstream
  tracker for bugs in this build; that was repointed here by @chloeroform in
  [#1298](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1298), and
  this finishes the last link that was still wrong.
  ([#1361](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1361))

- **Kobo syncs wrote to the database once per book instead of once per batch.**
  Each book a Kobo received was recorded in its own separate save, so a sync
  carrying a hundred books did a hundred separate writes — and everyone else's
  pages waited behind them. It's now one write per batch. You'll notice it most
  on a device's first sync and on libraries kept on a NAS, where each write is
  slow.

- **Kobo book covers froze the site while they were being prepared.** Covers are
  padded to your Kobo's screen shape the first time each one is needed, which is
  a fraction of a second of image work — but it was holding up every other page
  while it ran, and it happens once per cover, so a device catching up on a
  shelf-full stacked those pauses back to back. The padding now happens out of
  the way. This affects anyone with Kobo sync on, since cover padding is on by
  default; nothing about the covers themselves changes.

- **With "proxy unknown requests to Kobo Store" turned on, your Kobo could stall
  the site for seconds at a time.** Some of what a Kobo asks for is passed
  through to Kobo's own servers, and the site sat still waiting for their reply —
  up to 12 seconds if they were slow to answer, with everyone else's pages
  waiting too. Measured against the real store, individual calls took anywhere
  from 0.1 to 1.1 seconds. The waiting now happens out of the way. Only affects
  you if you turned that setting on; it's off by default.

- **Sending a large book to a Kobo briefly froze the site for everyone else.**
  If you have "embed metadata" turned on, every book sent to a Kobo is rebuilt
  on the way out so its details are up to date — and that rebuild was holding up
  every other page in the meantime. On a 24 MB book, an unrelated page load went
  from about 10 ms to 493 ms; it now stays at 21 ms, and the book still arrives
  just as fast.

- **A book could end up permanently broken on your Kobo if the server was
  restarted at the wrong moment.** While converting a book for Kobo, the new file
  was written straight into place, so stopping the container mid-write left a
  half-written book behind — and the next run would accept that half-written file
  as finished and record it in the library. From then on your Kobo was handed a
  file it couldn't finish opening, and nothing would ever repair it. Converted
  books are now written aside and only swapped in once complete and verified as a
  readable archive, and a damaged file is never accepted as finished.

- **One unreadable or unwritable book could stop every other book being prepared
  for Kobo — on every restart, forever.** If a single book failed to convert, for
  instance because the library is mounted read-only, the whole preparation run
  stopped at that book and started over from scratch at the next restart, getting
  no further. It now skips what it can't do, reports how many failed, and finishes
  the rest.

- **Right after updating, books sent to a Kobo could arrive in the wrong format
  and take 25 seconds each.** The first run after the update prepares your Kobo
  books in the background, and a download arriving during that window queued up
  behind the whole job, timed out, and fell back to the plain format. Downloads
  now go through immediately while that background work is still running.

- **Kobo syncs were slow on big libraries, and froze everything else while they
  ran.** Every sync re-opened and re-parsed each book's EPUB from disk just to
  check one rarely-used property, every single time — and because that reading
  happened inside the sync request, nobody else could load a page until it
  finished. That answer never changes unless the file itself does, so it's now
  remembered. Measured on a 215-book library on local disk, the per-100-book cost
  dropped from 400 ms to 11 ms; on a first sync after a restart it dropped from
  about 6 seconds to the same 11 ms. Two honest caveats: the memory holds 4,096
  books, and a sync walks the library in order, so libraries larger than that see
  little benefit on a full sync; and on a NAS or network share each book still
  costs one small filesystem check, so the saving is real but smaller than the
  local-disk numbers above.

- **The whole server paused whenever a Kobo asked for a book it hadn't converted
  yet.** The first time a Kobo downloaded any book that didn't already have a
  kepub, the conversion ran inside that request and froze every other page for
  everyone until it finished — and because it queued behind whatever else the
  server was doing, a download landing behind a long import or conversion held
  the freeze for that job's whole duration too. Measured on a 24 MB book, an
  unrelated page load went from 9 ms to 754 ms; it now stays at 21 ms.

- **The whole library stops responding while a book is being imported.** Saving
  a metadata edit, renaming or merging a tag, or uploading while an import was
  running could stop the server answering *anyone* — not just the person who
  saved, but every page for every user, until the import finished. Nothing was
  logged and it recovered on its own, so it read as "the server is randomly
  slow" rather than as one action blocking the rest. Both jobs need the same
  library lock, and the web side waited for it in a way that also parked the
  thread every other request is served from. It now waits without holding
  everyone else up: the edit still queues behind the import, which is correct
  and unchanged, but the rest of the library stays usable while it does.
  Measured on a test instance, an unrelated page load during that wait went
  from 6.5 seconds to 36 milliseconds.

- **The new tag tools read in English on an otherwise Russian interface.**
  Merging a tag, deleting one, and the confirmation prompts that tell you how
  many books are affected all arrived in v4.1.30 without Russian text, so the
  Tags page switched to English at exactly the point it was asking you to
  confirm something destructive. Two upload and reading-position messages had
  the same gap. The new interface falls back to its English text when a phrase
  is missing rather than reporting anything, so the page still worked and
  simply stopped being translated. All thirteen phrases are now translated and
  Russian is complete again at 2,622 of 2,622. Contributed by

## [v4.1.30] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Tags can be merged and deleted from the Tags page.** Tidying up a library
  meant living with whatever tags had accumulated. Renaming a tag onto a
  near-duplicate — "Sci-Fi" onto "SciFi", which is how you merge two tags into
  one — was refused with "A tag with that name already exists", so consolidating
  them was impossible, and there was no way to delete a tag at all, not from the
  Tags list and not from a tag's own page. Now the rename tells you which tag it
  clashed with and how many books that one has, and offers to merge into it; the
  books move across and the leftover tag disappears. Delete removes a tag from
  every book that carries it, and the books themselves are kept. Both are on the
  Tags list itself, so you can spot near-duplicates side by side and fix them
  without opening each tag first, and both ask before they change anything.
  Editing metadata is required, so read-only accounts and guests see the plain
  list as before. Reported by @magdalar.

### Fixed

- **Series and other metadata edits now reach your Kobo.** Setting a series name
  and number on a book saved fine in the library, and the change showed up in the
  web interface, but the book on a Kobo still had no series — and downloading the
  file back confirmed the series was missing from it. Books converted for Kobo are
  stored as `.kepub` files, and those were the one format the metadata writer
  skipped, so every edit reached the `.epub` and the library while the file your
  reader actually opens was left untouched. Re-saving did not help, because
  nothing was wrong with the edit. `.kepub` files are now written too, so setting
  or changing a series, adding tags and updating the cover turn up on the device
  after the next sync. Clearing a field is not covered yet — remove a series or a
  tag and the `.kepub` keeps the old value, tracked in #1376. Existing books pick
  up their metadata the next time you edit them, or in one pass from Settings if
  you run the cover and metadata enforcement over the whole library. Reading
  positions and bookmarks already on your reader are preserved. Reported by
  @bjekel.

- **Books already sitting in the ingest folder when the container starts are
  now imported.** If a book was waiting in the ingest folder at the moment
  Calibre-Web NextGen started — you copied files in while it was stopped, the
  server rebooted mid-copy, or an import was still pending when the container
  restarted — it was never picked up. No error appeared, nothing showed in the
  log, and the book simply never arrived in the library. Restarting did not
  help; the only way out was to touch or re-copy every file. The ingest folder
  is now swept once at startup, so anything waiting there gets imported. Books
  left in the retry queue by a previous run are also picked back up instead of
  waiting for an unrelated file to arrive.

### Security

- **Requests that change your library are now refused when they come from
  another website.** Every write the new interface makes already had to carry a
  one-time token, and a page on another site cannot read that token — but if one
  ever obtained it, the server would have carried out the write without noticing
  the request came from somewhere else entirely. It now checks, for the whole
  `/api/v1` surface at once rather than route by route, and refuses anything that
  says it came from a site other than yours. Nothing changes for ordinary use:
  your own browser identifies itself correctly, and tools like `curl` or a script
  that send no such information keep working as before. If you reach your library
  through a reverse proxy, it has to tell the server both the address **and**
  whether the connection is `https` — a proxy that handles TLS but forwards no
  `X-Forwarded-Proto` leaves the server thinking the request arrived over plain
  `http`, and writes are refused even though the address matches. Most proxies do
  this correctly out of the box. If yours does not, either forward
  `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto`, or set the existing `PROXY_HOST` and
  `PROXY_SCHEME` variables, or name the address you actually use in a new optional
  `CWNG_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` setting, comma-separated. No setting is needed for a
  normal install, and the same symptom already showed up as `http://` links in
  emails and redirects, so a install that works today is very likely unaffected.

- **The Statistics page no longer shows your server's version details to
  everyone.** It listed the exact Calibre-Web NextGen release, the host kernel
  build, the Python build and the version of every library the server uses —
  around 70 entries — to any visitor who could open the page. On an instance
  with guest browsing turned on, that included people who were not signed in at
  all. It is enough detail to look up known vulnerabilities for the exact
  software you are running, which matters if your instance is reachable from
  the internet. Those details now go to admins only, and the server withholds
  them rather than just hiding them on the page, so they are no longer sent to
  anyone else. Book, author, series and category counts are unchanged for
  everyone. Reported by @kabili207; @chloeroform sent the first fix and the
  page-side change.

## [v4.1.29] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **Marking a book unread no longer marks it read instead.** Telling a book you
  had not read it — from the book editor, a bulk edit, or the API — set it to
  *read* whenever that book had never been marked either way before. The
  opposite of what was asked, and the only way to notice was to look at the
  checkmark afterwards. It happened on ordinary libraries and on ones where an
  admin has pointed Calibre-Web at a custom column for read status. Both now
  record what you actually asked for.

  Read status is also kept in step now if you use a custom column for it.
  Calibre-Web tracks reading in two places — your column, and an internal record
  the Kobo and KOReader sync both write to — and only the column was being
  updated when you toggled a book. So the "Currently reading" marker could drift
  away from the checkmark on the book, and a book you had marked Read could
  still be reported to your Kobo as one you were part-way through. Both records
  now follow the toggle.

  One limit worth knowing if you use a custom read column: the toggle reaches
  your Kobo for books it has already synced, but not yet for a book the device
  has never seen. That gap is tracked on
  [#1350](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1350).

- **Japanese and Chinese ebooks now turn the page the right way in the new
  reader.** Books that read right-to-left were paged as if they read
  left-to-right: the button to go forward sat on the right of the screen, so
  tapping the side you actually read towards took you backwards a page instead
  of onwards. The arrow keys were reversed in the same way. Forward now sits on
  the left for these books, where it belongs, and the buttons announce what they
  really do for anyone using a screen reader. Books that read left-to-right are
  unchanged.

  This covers epub. Comics and manga read as CBZ or CBR still page
  left-to-right — they carry no equivalent marker for reading direction, so that
  needs its own detection and is tracked on
  [#1354](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1354).

- **Your reading position survives a busy database instead of being dropped.**
  Both readers save your place constantly — the classic reader on every page
  turn, the new one every second or so — and if that save failed because
  something else was writing to the database at that moment, the browser was
  told it had worked. It hadn't: the position was thrown away, and because the
  browser thought it was saved, nothing ever went back for it. You would come
  back to the book and find yourself pages behind, with nothing in the log to
  explain it. A save that fails now reports the failure instead of a success,
  and both readers act on it: the new reader retries a few times, and the
  classic reader keeps your place locally and sends it the next time you open
  the book.

  Two honest limits. There is still no on-screen warning when a save fails for
  good — the new reader announces it to screen readers only
  ([#1352](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1352)) —
  and if you close the tab within a few seconds of turning a page, the new
  reader can still lose that last page turn. Neither is a step back from the
  previous release; the new reader did not send your position anywhere at all
  before this one.

  The same "said it worked when it didn't" answer turned up in three other
  places, all now fixed: changing an admin password from the command line could
  print "Password for user X changed" and exit successfully when the change had
  in fact been rolled back; revoking a Kobo sync token could report success
  while the token stayed valid; and editing an allowed-registration domain in
  the admin panel could show the new value in the table without it being saved.

- **The Epub Fixer stops reporting the same fixes every time you run it, and
  stops touching books you deleted.** Running it over the same library
  repeatedly kept listing conversions like "Converted page_styles.css from
  ascii to utf-8" — on every run, for books it had already been through. The
  conversion was never real: a stylesheet that is plain ASCII is *already*
  valid UTF-8, so nothing was being changed, but it was counted and announced
  as a fix anyway. Worse, every book was rewritten and copied into the backup
  folder whether or not anything about it changed, so a library-wide run
  restamped every file — which pushes the whole library back through Kobo,
  KOReader and any file-sync you have set up, and grew the backup folder every
  time. Books that genuinely need fixing are still fixed, backed up and
  rewritten exactly as before; books that don't are now left alone, and the log
  says "No issues found" instead of inventing two. A book whose language
  Calibre never set was counted the same way: the fixer left the language
  exactly as it found it and still recorded that as a repair, adding a row to
  the Epub Fixer history on every run. It no longer does. The fixer also no
  longer walks Calibre's hidden `.caltrash` folder, so books you deleted are no
  longer processed and reported alongside the ones in your library.

- **The "update available" banner stops re-appearing every time you restart.**
  The banner is meant to show at most once a day, and it remembered the date it
  last appeared in a file. That file was kept in a part of the container that
  gets wiped whenever the container is recreated, which is exactly what happens
  when you pull a new image. So the reminder forgot itself at the one moment it
  was most likely to be redundant, and admins saw it again on the next page
  load. It now lives in your `/config` folder alongside the logs, so the
  once-a-day promise holds across restarts and upgrades. You may see the banner
  one extra time on the first start after updating, then it settles.
  Thanks to @chloeroform for finding and fixing this.

### Added

- **Reading in your browser now counts towards your reading progress
  everywhere else.** Until now the web reader kept its position to itself: it
  could *show* you how far your Kobo or KOReader had got, but reading a few
  chapters in the browser left no trace. Your Kobo still thought you were where
  you left it, and the book still showed the old percentage in your library.
  Picking a book up on the web during a lunch break and then going back to your
  device meant finding your place by hand. Now the position you reach in the
  browser travels the other way too — your Kobo picks it up on its next sync,
  the progress shown on the book updates, and finishing a book in the browser
  marks it read. Both the classic reader and the new interface do this.

  Reading backwards never costs you anything: if your Kobo is at 80% and you
  flip back to chapter 1 in the browser, your own place in the browser follows
  you, but the furthest point stays 80% so nothing on your device is lost.
  Starting a book over is still "mark as unread", which clears it everywhere as
  it always has.

  One honest limit: this covers the Kobo direction and the progress shown in
  your library. KOReader reads its position from a separate store in a format
  only KOReader understands, so it doesn't pick up browser reading yet — that
  half needs a position translation and is still tracked on
  [#324](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/324).

  Worth knowing if your server has several users *and* an admin has pointed
  Calibre-Web at a custom column for read status: that column belongs to the
  book rather than to each reader, so one person finishing a book in the
  browser now shows it as read for everyone. Marking a book read by hand always
  worked that way on those libraries; what is new is that reading to the end
  does it too. Ordinary libraries keep read status per person and are
  unaffected. Discussion of what the right behaviour should be is on
  [#1351](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1351).

## [v4.1.28] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- **The button at the bottom of a page works again while the "new interface"
  notice is on screen.** The notice sits along the bottom of the window, and it
  was covering the last thing on the page — so clicking the middle of that
  button did nothing at all, and only a thin sliver along its top edge
  responded. Scrolling all the way down did not help. The clearest case was the
  emergency "Restore Calibre Database (Last Resort)" button on Admin → Database
  Configuration, but it applied to any page ending in a button or a link. On
  phones it was worse: the notice is taller there because it wraps onto two
  lines, and it hid the last button completely rather than just its lower edge.
  Pages now keep enough space clear at the bottom for the notice, at every
  screen size. Dismissing the notice was always a workaround and still is; you
  no longer need it.

- **The emergency "Restore Calibre Database (Last Resort)" button now actually
  restores.** On Admin → Database Configuration, clicking it did nothing at all —
  no message, no error, no restore. It was quietly saving the database settings
  again instead, so anyone reaching for it during a real library corruption got
  a button that looked like it worked and didn't. It now rebuilds your Calibre
  database from the OPF files in your library, as the page describes. The rest of
  the page is unchanged, and the Save button is unaffected. Spotted and diagnosed
  upstream by @luisalduucin.

- **Typing a page address with a slash on the end no longer gives you "404 Not
  Found".** `/kosync/` failed while `/kosync` worked, and the same was true of
  156 other pages — admin settings, your profile, statistics, search, the shelf
  and author pages. Links inside the app were always fine, so this only bit
  people who typed an address, bookmarked one, or followed a link from a forum
  post that happened to end in a slash. Addresses that end in a slash now take
  you to the page instead of an error, including behind a reverse proxy on a
  sub-path. Reported by @iroQuai.
- **The admin settings page no longer leaves one option in English.** With the
  interface in another language, the "Default book language" dropdown still
  opened on "Show All" while every other label on the page was translated. It
  now reads in your own language — "Alle talen" in Dutch, "Montrer tout" in
  French. The same dropdown in your account settings was already correct; both
  pages now build it from one place, so they cannot drift apart again. Reported
  by @iroQuai.
- **The Upload button no longer disappears once you browse anywhere.** In the
  new UI it only ever showed on the plain Library page, so the moment you opened
  an author, a series, a tag, Hot, Discover, Top Rated or a book, there was no
  way to add a book at all — the classic view keeps Upload in the toolbar on
  every page. Upload now stays put while you browse, and it is also in the
  account menu (next to Admin), so it is reachable from anywhere including on a
  phone. Reported through the in-app feedback form.
- **"Enable Uploads" now actually disables uploads.** Switching it off in Admin
  hid the button in the classic view but nothing more — the new UI still offered
  Upload, and the upload request still went through either way. The setting is
  now enforced on the server and the button is hidden in both views. Uploading
  stays on by default, so nothing changes unless you deliberately turned it off.

## [v4.1.27] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- **The admin "Version Information" table now reports the Calibre you are
  actually running.** It used to show a value stamped into the image at build
  time, so if the Calibre binaries had been replaced, or the converter path
  pointed somewhere else, the number on the page was not the number in use.
  It is now read from the binary itself — the same source the Statistics page
  already used — and formatted as `v9.11.0` to match the rows above it. When
  Calibre can't be found or can't be run, the row now says which of the two it
  is instead of "Unknown". Thanks to @chloeroform for the change.

- **The Kepubify row of that same table now reports the running binary too.**
  It had the same problem for the same reason, and it was the more visible of
  the pair: the Statistics page already read the real binary, so the two pages
  could show different Kepubify versions on the same install with no way to
  tell which one was right. Both now read the same source. As with Calibre, a
  Kepubify that can't be found or can't be run says so rather than showing
  "Unknown". Thanks again to @chloeroform.

- **The Russian interface is complete again — the custom-columns section of the
  edit-metadata screen now reads in Russian.** Three phrases there were still in
  English on an otherwise fully Russian page: the "Custom columns" heading, the
  "Not set" placeholder shown for an empty column, and the hint telling you a
  field takes comma-separated values. Russian is back to every string
  translated. Contributed by
  [@standhaftsohnsergius](https://github.com/standhaftsohnsergius)
  ([#1269](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1269)).

### Fixed

- **The "Duplicates found" popup kept naming books you had already deleted.**
  If you removed duplicate copies in Calibre itself rather than in the web app,
  the popup carried on listing them — while the Duplicates page and a fresh
  scan both correctly reported nothing. The popup was reading a list saved at
  the time of the last scan and never re-checked it against your actual
  library, so it was the one place still remembering the deleted books. It now
  re-checks before it shows, and a group whose books are gone (or archived, or
  hidden from you) drops out. Groups that merely lost one copy now show the
  real remaining count instead of the stale one. The sidebar duplicate badge
  reads the same number, so it was wrong in the same way and is fixed too.

- **A duplicate you dismissed could come back on its own.** Dismissals were
  being matched against a label built from the title and author of whichever
  copy happened to sort first, so editing a book's metadata — or importing
  another copy — quietly changed the label and the dismissal stopped applying.
  Dismissals now hold onto a stable identity that metadata edits don't move.
  Thanks to @blahblah57, whose report on the duplicates popup led here.

- **Marking a book unread left its "Started reading" and "Last synced" dates on
  the page.** The percentage cleared, but the two dates stayed — and "Last
  synced" jumped forward to the moment you pressed the button, so a book you had
  just marked unread looked like it had synced seconds ago. The reading position
  the device holds was also left behind, which meant a Kobo could quietly restore
  the exact spot you had just cleared on its next sync. Marking a book unread now
  clears the whole position: both dates and the device resume point. Books that
  were already left in this state by an earlier version display correctly again
  without any migration. Thanks to @uschi1 for catching it and following up.

- **Saving a book from the edit-metadata screen, or switching on a metadata
  source, made the server stop answering everyone.** Not only the tab doing the
  work — every other person's page load hung for as long as the cover download
  or the metadata lookup took, which on a slow cover host is up to 30 seconds.
  Both actions now do their network work off the request handler, so the rest of
  the site keeps responding while they run. Measured on a real server during a
  1.5s cover download: other page loads went from 1 request served with a
  1254ms worst-case wait, to 201 served with an 18ms worst case.

## [v4.1.26] - 2026-07-31

### Changed

- **Ebook conversion and metadata reading now run on Calibre 9.11.0**, up from
  9.1.0. Ten minor versions of Calibre fixes land in one step, covering format
  conversion, metadata extraction and the ingest path — so books that previously
  converted badly, imported with wrong or missing metadata, or failed to ingest
  at all are worth retrying. Thanks to @chloeroform for the upgrade and
  @darkmatterpelican for reporting it.

### Fixed

- **KOReader's plugin updater kept saying "no new release available" when a newer
  sync plugin existed.** If you had pointed Updates Manager (or
  appstore.koplugin) at the main Calibre-Web NextGen repository, it stopped
  finding updates after v4.1.16 — nine releases in a row shipped no plugin
  download for it to see, so it reported you were current while three plugin
  fixes went out without reaching your device. Plugin-changing releases now
  attach the plugin download automatically, so that setup updates itself again.
  Releases that don't touch the plugin still publish nothing, so you won't be
  prompted to reinstall an identical plugin.

- **The interface now reads in Polish throughout, instead of leaving about two
  thirds of its labels in English.** With the language set to Polish, the admin
  screens, metadata editing, upload, shelves, the reader and a long tail of task
  and error messages still showed in English. A further 273 phrases were worse
  than untranslated: gettext had guessed them from a similar English sentence and
  marked the guess provisional, and a provisional entry is dropped when the
  catalog is compiled — so those rendered in English while Polish that said
  something else sat in the file waiting for somebody to confirm it. Polish was
  covering 950 of 2,609 phrases and now covers all 2,609, which makes it the most
  complete translation the project ships. Contributed by
  [@bywciu](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1249)
  ([#1249](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1249)),
  building on the original Polish translation by Radosław Kierznowski.

- **German now reads in German across several hundred more labels and
  messages.** With the language set to German, a long tail of admin screens,
  task and error messages, and much of the new interface still showed in
  English. German was covering 1,584 of 2,609 phrases and now covers 1,891.
  Two of those were previously worse than untranslated: the *Email Your Users*
  admin heading said "Benutzer bearbeiten" ("edit user") and the warning for
  sending mail with nobody chosen said "select a book" rather than "select a
  recipient". Both are now correct, and both now actually appear — gettext had
  them marked as unconfirmed guesses, and an unconfirmed entry is dropped when
  the catalog is compiled, so the German sat in the file while the screen
  showed English. Contributed by
  [@monimkxl-web](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1264)
  ([#1264](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1264)).

- **Every CWA settings page 404'd when the app was mounted under a subpath.** If
  you run Calibre-Web NextGen behind a reverse proxy on a prefix that starts the
  same way as its own pages — `/cwa` being the obvious one — then "CWA settings
  (ingest/convert)", "Duplicate detection settings", the statistics dashboard,
  and the library-refresh button all came back as Not Found, while the ordinary
  Admin links right beside them worked. That mismatch was the tell: the mount
  prefix was being removed from any address that merely *began* with the same
  letters, so `/cwa-settings` was cut down to `-settings`, which is not a page.
  All 37 CWA pages and actions were affected — settings, duplicate detection,
  library refresh, log viewing and downloads, the EPUB fixer, library conversion,
  scheduled tasks and the statistics screens. The prefix is now only removed at a
  real path boundary, so both styles of proxy setup work: one that strips the
  prefix before passing the request on, and one that leaves it in place. A prefix
  written with a trailing slash (`PROXY_SCRIPT_NAME=/cwa/`) is also accepted now
  — it used to break every page in a second, separate way. Reported by
  [@chloeroform](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1248)
  ([#1248](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1248)).

### Added

- **The KOReader page now explains how to auto-update the sync plugin.** Visiting
  `/kosync` only ever described the manual download-and-copy route, so the
  in-place update path existed but was undiscoverable — the repository to point
  an update manager at was written down nowhere a user would look. That page and
  the README now name it, and spell out why the plugin's version can sit behind
  your server version without anything being wrong.

## [v4.1.25] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **You can give ComicVine your own API key.** ComicVine searches have always
  gone out on a single key shipped inside the app that every install shares, so
  one busy install can use up the allowance for everyone and searches quietly
  come back empty. You can now put your own free key in the 🔑 Keys panel of the
  metadata search window and get your own allowance. Nothing changes if you
  don't: ComicVine keeps working out of the box on the shared key. If you prefer
  to configure it at the container level, `COMICVINE_API_KEY` and
  `COMICVINE_API_KEY_FILE` work too. When ComicVine does refuse a search, the log
  now says so and tells you which key was used, instead of looking like the book
  simply wasn't found. Reported by
  [@tomaioo](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1242)
  ([#1242](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1242)).

- **Custom columns are editable in the new UI.** Your own calibre columns — page
  counts, reading status, notes, shelf location — showed up on a book's page but
  there was nowhere to change them, so setting one meant switching back to the
  classic view. The edit screen now has a Custom columns section with the right
  control for each column type: a number box for integers, a date picker, a
  yes/no menu, a star rating, a text area for long notes, and a dropdown of the
  allowed values for enumerated columns. Reported by @jasonxbergman (#997) and
  by mx.meredith on Discord.

### Fixed

- **A mistyped API-key file path can no longer hang or crash the whole server.**
  If you supply a provider token by pointing `HARDCOVER_TOKEN_FILE` or
  `COMICVINE_API_KEY_FILE` at a file (the Docker-secrets style), the app reads
  that file when it needs the token. Point it at something that isn't a plain
  file — a named pipe nothing is writing to, or a device like `/dev/zero` — and
  the read never finished: the whole app froze, or memory climbed until it was
  killed. Both now fail cleanly with a log line naming the file, and the read is
  size-limited. A correctly configured secret file behaves exactly as before.

- **A custom column holding just the word "None" no longer erases itself when
  you save.** Type `None` into a notes or comments column — on its own, as the
  whole value — and the column came back empty, in both the new UI and the
  classic editor, with the save reporting success. Anything already in the
  column was lost. `None` is the value the yes/no dropdown uses behind the
  scenes to mean "not set", and that meaning was being applied to every kind
  of column, including free-text ones where it is ordinary writing. Number and
  date columns are deliberately unchanged: there the word still empties the
  field, as it always has
  ([#1233](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1233)).

- **Deleting a highlight in KOReader now actually removes it from the server.**
  Creating highlights synced fine, but deleting one reported "Server push
  failed" and the deletion never went anywhere — reopen the book on another
  device and the highlight was still there. The push was failing inside the
  plugin before it ever became a request, so nothing showed up in the server log
  either, which is why this took several passes to find. The KOReader plugin is
  updated to 4.1.25; open KOReader's Updates Manager to pick it up, or the plugin
  page in its menu will show the new version. Reported by
  [@iroQuai](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/920)
  ([#920](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/920),
  [#905](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/905),
  [#699](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/699)).

- **The version number on the admin page no longer links to a release that
  doesn't exist.** On a build that was never stamped with a version — running
  from a source checkout rather than one of the published Docker images — the
  version read `v0.0.0`, and because that looks like an ordinary version it was
  turned into a link to a release tag of that name, which 404s. It now renders
  as plain text when there is nothing real to point at. The same page also
  stopped showing a stray blank line after the version, and now agrees with the
  version the app reports to other services. Contributed by
  [@chloeroform](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1231)
  ([#1231](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1231)).

- **Brazilian Portuguese covers 120 more of the interface, and 57 phrases that
  were holding the wrong text are corrected.** With the language set to
  Brazilian Portuguese, the Hardcover match-review screens, the announcement
  email form, backup and restore messages, the app-password help text and a
  long tail of task and error messages still read in English. Some of those
  were worse than untranslated: gettext had guessed them from a similar English
  sentence and marked the guess provisional, so the file was holding Portuguese
  that said something else entirely — "Hardcover ID applied successfully" was
  carrying the text for "{} user(s) removed successfully", and "Email Your
  Users" was carrying "Edit Users". A provisional entry is dropped when the
  catalog is compiled, so those showed in English while the wrong Portuguese sat
  in the file waiting for somebody to confirm it. All 57 are now written out
  properly, which takes Brazilian Portuguese to 1,409 of 2,609 phrases.

- **Ingest told you to install an ACSM plugin you already had.** When an `.acsm`
  fulfillment ticket failed to convert, the log always said no ACSM-capable
  plugin was installed — even when one was installed, had run, and had printed
  the actual reason it gave up, such as `DeACSM v0.0.16: ADE auth is missing or
  broken`. That sent people looking for a missing plugin instead of at the real
  problem. The ingest log now repeats the plugin's own reason when a plugin ran,
  and still suggests installing one only when nothing handled the file. Reported

## [v4.1.24] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **The "Browse languages" button on the What's New page now reads in Russian.** Russian is otherwise fully translated, so this one phrase sat in English on a screen that already said "Просмотр авторов" and "Просмотр тегов" right beside it. The new interface uses its English text as the lookup key, so a missing translation quietly renders the English rather than reporting anything — which is how a single gap like this survives until someone reading the page notices it. Russian is now complete at 2,606 of 2,606 phrases. Contributed by [@standhaftsohnsergius](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1220) ([#1220](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1220)).

- **The new interface now speaks Dutch throughout, instead of showing most of its labels in English.** The sidebar, search, upload, book pages, shelves and settings were largely English even with the language set to Dutch, which is what "several labels are still in english, others in Dutch" meant when it was reported. Nothing was broken, which is why it lasted: the new interface uses its English text as the lookup key, so a missing translation quietly shows the English rather than reporting anything, and only someone reading the screens would notice. Of the 821 phrases the new interface can translate, Dutch had 84. It now has all of them — 737 added. Along the way the wording was lined up with the Dutch already used on the older screens, so tags read as "Labels" and shelves as "Boekenplanken" everywhere rather than changing name depending on which page you were looking at. The five built-in shelves ("Currently Reading", "Highly Rated" and the rest) were a separate problem found while checking the fix: they come from a different part of the code, so they sat in English in an otherwise Dutch sidebar even once everything else was translated, and they are now Dutch too. So were the sidebar's Appearance and theme settings, the sort fields, the whole list of search filter conditions ("contains", "is between", "is empty") and the What's New buttons: the check that was meant to catch missing Dutch could only see phrases written out at the point they are displayed, and those are assembled from a list, so 76 of them were never checked and stayed English while the check reported Dutch as complete. The check now works from the full set of phrases the app ships for translation, which is what the two earlier gaps had in common, so a phrase cannot go missing by virtue of how it happens to be written. Release notes stay in English on purpose. Other languages are still mostly untranslated in the new interface and are tracked separately. Reported by [@iroQuai](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/886) ([#886](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/886), [#1217](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1217)).

- **Most of the new interface now speaks French instead of falling back to English.** Uploading a book, editing its metadata, the Files and convert-format panel, your profile page, the admin screens, the cover picker and the reader were largely in English even with the interface set to French. Nothing was broken, which is why it lasted: the new interface uses its English text as the lookup key, so a missing translation quietly shows the English rather than reporting anything, and only someone reading the screens would notice. Of the 821 phrases the new interface can translate, French had 276. It now has all of them — 545 added — so the pages in the report are covered along with the ones not yet reached, including the Appearance and theme settings, the sort fields and the full list of search filter conditions ("contains", "is between", "is empty"). Two checks were added so this cannot creep back unnoticed: one fails the build if a French phrase goes missing, and one covers all 28 languages, catching a translation that loses a placeholder like the name in "Reset password for {name}" — which would look translated while rendering wrong. Release notes stay in English on purpose. Other languages are still mostly untranslated in the new interface and are tracked separately. Reported by [@hayvan96](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/615) ([#615](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/615)).

- **A KOReader sync that could not read the device's highlights no longer reports them as deleted.** To work out what you removed, the plugin compares the highlights on the device now against the ones it last sent, and anything missing is named to the server as a deletion. Whether it had actually managed to read the device was decided by a fixed property of the device type rather than by the read itself, so a read that came back with nothing was indistinguishable from a book you had cleared by hand — and every highlight in it was named for deletion. Coming back with nothing is not unusual: the plugin picks the source before asking the server for the book's highlights and reads it afterwards, so closing the book while that request is in flight is enough, as is the reader's own database being locked or an SD card being pulled. The server carries out the deletions it is given and does not bring a deleted highlight back, so the loss was permanent. A read that fails now says so, and a sync that cannot see your highlights leaves them alone; one that genuinely finds none still syncs the deletion, so removing your last highlight works as before. Found while investigating [#920](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/920), reported by [@iroQuai](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/699). Needs plugin 4.1.24 on the device.

- **Adding a book no longer fills the log with "Permission denied" warnings, and the one-time database upgrades now actually record that they've run.** Every ingest printed five warnings about being unable to write to `/app/calibre-web-automated/.cwa_migrations`, a folder that doesn't exist and isn't writable. The upgrades themselves worked, so nothing was broken in a way you could see — but because they could never write down that they'd finished, they ran again from scratch on every single book that came in. The cause was that the app works out where to keep its own files from a setting that was only being handed to two of the eleven background services. The ingest service wasn't one of them, so it kept its notes in the program folder instead of your config folder, while everything else used the right one. That setting is now applied once for the whole container, so every service agrees on where state lives, including any added later. Reported by [@auspex](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1162) ([#1162](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1162)).

- **When a highlight fails to sync, KOReader now tells you why instead of just "Server push failed".** The plugin knew the reason and threw it away: it was written to the debug log, which is off unless you have turned it on, and the part of the code that shows the message was handed a blank. So a sync that never left the device looked exactly like one the server had rejected, and neither the device nor the server had anything written down about it. The reason is now shown on screen and recorded in `crash.log`. This is a diagnostic change rather than a fix for the underlying failure, and it is what the remaining investigation into highlight deletions ([#920](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/920), reported by [@iroQuai](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/920)) has been waiting on.

- **A running install is told about new releases again, instead of being stuck on whatever was newest the day its container started.** The admin page's "Update available" line compared your installed version against a value fetched once, at container start, and written to a file — so a container that had been up for a week was still comparing against the release list from a week earlier, and the notice for anything published since never appeared. Restarting the container was the only way to refresh it, which is the one thing someone who doesn't know an update exists has no reason to do. The latest release is now looked up when the page is actually rendered, cached for six hours so it costs at most a handful of requests a day, and run on a background thread so a slow lookup delays only that one page and never holds up anyone else's browsing. Two related mix-ups went with it: `--version` on the command line and the updater's own version report both named the newest *published* release rather than the one you were running, which made the updater tell some installs they were already current when they weren't. Reported by [@chloeroform](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1108) ([#1108](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1108)).

## [v4.1.23] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **A newly imported book no longer has a different book's details written over it.** With automatic metadata fetching switched on, importing a book would sometimes replace its correct title, author and description with those of an entirely different book — often another title by the same author, sometimes one that isn't published yet. Nothing flagged it: the log read `Successfully applied`, and the only way to notice was to spot the wrong book in your library later. The cause was that whichever result a metadata site happened to list first was accepted without checking it was even the same book. A freshly imported file usually carries no ISBN, and the ISBN was the only thing being checked. Results are now matched on the title's identifying words, and one that doesn't match — or that matches the title but names a different author — is refused, leaving the book as it was imported. Books in a series are the case this most needed to get right, since their titles differ by only a word or two. Reported by [@auspex](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1164) ([#1164](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1164)).

- **A book you just edited no longer drops out of your library.** Save a change to a book, head back to the library, and the book you had just edited was missing from the grid until you reloaded the page. The library holds on to the cards it has already loaded so that coming back from a book leaves you where you were, and saving an edit was pulling the edited book straight out of that store — which is the right thing to do when a book is deleted, and the wrong thing here. The book still exists and still belongs in the list, and the only page the library asks for again on the way back is the one you were sitting on, so a book from any earlier page had nothing to bring it back. Where it did return, it returned as the very last card of everything loaded, which from the top of the library is indistinguishable from gone. An edited book now keeps its place in the list and shows its new title, author and series straight away, including on pages you have scrolled past. Reported by [@magdalar](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1169) ([#1169](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1169)).

- **KOReader devices stopped recognising a book once its file changed on the server, and re-downloading it never helped.** Progress sync identifies a book by a fingerprint of the file's contents, and the server only knows the fingerprints of files it has actually served. The plugin was reading that fingerprint out of KOReader's own cache, which is stored per file location and survives the file at that location being replaced. So once a book's file changed on the server (a Calibre database rebuild, a metadata write-back, a re-import), the device kept reporting the fingerprint of a copy it no longer held, and the server logged `No book found for checksum`. Re-downloading the book made things worse rather than better, because each download registered one more fingerprint the device would never produce. The plugin now works the fingerprint out from the file it actually has, and falls back to the cached value only when that file cannot be read. Update the NextGen Progress Sync plugin to 4.1.23 on each device to pick this up. Reported by [@Metamatam](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/991) ([#991](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/991)).

- **The edit pencil no longer sits on top of a book's series or author line, and "Read now" no longer breaks across two lines on a phone.** The bottom of each book card wasn't a real layout: the pencil floated over the card and room for it was reserved by padding the "Read now" label. That works only while the card is wider than the space being reserved — on a phone in Compact or Dense view the card is around 82–106 pixels and the reservation alone was 60, so the label wrapped, the row grew, and the pencil rode up into the line above it. Books with no readable format had no "Read now" at all, so the pencil landed directly on the series. The two controls now share one row, sized by the browser rather than guessed at, and on the narrowest cards the pencil scales down and the label gives way to its icon instead of being squeezed. Reported by rogovmtlz on Discord, [@iroQuai](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1166) and [@HLRobius](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1166) ([#1166](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1166), [#1112](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1112)).

- **A book whose title, author or series contains one very long word no longer drags the page sideways on a phone.** The header column beside the cover is only about 217 pixels wide on a phone, and a word longer than that — a German compound title, a long transliterated name, a lengthy series title — ran straight past the edge and made the whole book page scroll horizontally. Those three lines now wrap mid-word when a word cannot fit on a line by itself; ordinary titles are unchanged, since wrapping still prefers to break between words ([#1178](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1178)).

## [v4.1.22] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- **The "read" mark on a book cover is now a green "Read" label at the bottom-left, instead of a small tick in the corner.** It was a 22-pixel checkmark circle in the top-right with no wording, which was easy to miss at a glance — the reporter, who reads in the light theme because of their eyesight, pointed out that the classic view's labelled green badge was far easier to spot. It now says what it means, sits where the classic one sits, and gets larger again on phones and tablets. The wording follows your language, so a German library reads "Gelesen" exactly as the classic view does. Reported by [@uschi1](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/351) ([#1117](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1117)).


### Fixed

- **Books whose language is written as `ger`, `fre` or `dut` now show that language instead of "Unknown".** A language can be recorded two ways in book metadata: `deu`/`fra`/`nld`, which is what Calibre normally writes, or `ger`/`fre`/`dut`, which is what library-catalogue records and some EPUB files carry. Only the first form was recognised, so a book using the second showed "Unknown" as its language on the book page and in the language list, and importing one could be rejected outright with "'ger' is not a valid language". Both forms are now accepted for all twenty languages where they differ — German, French, Dutch, Chinese, Czech, Greek, Icelandic, Persian, Welsh and the rest. Relatedly, whether a language counts as valid no longer depends on the language you read the interface in. The list of language names is translated separately for each interface language and is incomplete for most of them, and importing checked a book against that list, so a Greek book could be refused as invalid for someone using the site in Portuguese while importing normally for someone using it in English. Imports are now checked against the full list of languages instead. The log line this produced on every single lookup has also been lowered from an error to a warning, since a language code we don't recognise is a detail of the book's metadata and not a fault in the server ([#1109](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1109)).

- **Two people using the library at once no longer break each other's pages.** The server kept one working copy of your library data and shared it across every request it was handling. As soon as any one page finished, it closed that copy, so any other page still being built lost the books it had already read and failed. In the log it showed up as `Instance ... is not persistent within this Session`, pointing at whatever the unlucky page happened to be doing at the time, which made it look like a different bug on every occurrence. It got likelier the busier the server was, so it hit big libraries, shared instances and anything running during an import hardest. Each request now keeps its own working copy ([#1150](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1150)).
- **A page you are reading no longer breaks because a background job finished.** Duplicate scans, thumbnail generation, metadata backups and Hardcover syncs all share the server's connection to your library, and when one of them finished it could close that connection while a page you had open was still reading from it. The page then failed, usually with `Cannot operate on a closed database` in the log. It was intermittent by nature — it only bit when the timing overlapped, which is why a manual scan could break browsing once and then work fine on the next try. Background jobs and page loads now keep their own handle on the library, so one finishing can no longer interrupt the other ([#1121](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1121), reported downstream of [#1048](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1048) by [@auspex](https://github.com/auspex)).

- **Your library keeps working when its extra fields can't be read.** Book pages, the books table and both search screens all ask the library for its custom-column definitions — the extra fields you can add to a book in Calibre. If that lookup failed because the library was mid-write, its folder had moved, or the definitions table wasn't there yet, those pages returned an error instead of simply leaving the extra fields out, even though the rest of the library was perfectly readable. Custom columns are supplementary, so these pages now load without them and note the reason in the log ([#1153](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1153)).

- **A book that fails to convert now still lands in your library.** If CWA could not convert an incoming book to your target format — a big or image-heavy PDF that ran out of time, a file with internals Calibre chokes on, a format needing a plugin you don't have — the book was dropped altogether: no entry in the library, and the file gone from the ingest folder. The log even said `Successfully processed` on its way past, so nothing suggested a book had gone missing until you noticed it wasn't there. A failed conversion says nothing about whether the file is a readable book, and the two settings that decline to convert — auto-convert switched off, or the format on your do-not-convert list — already import the original, so this was inconsistent as well as lossy. The original is now imported whenever a conversion fails.

  A long conversion needed a second fix to get there. Nothing inside the app limited how long a conversion could run; the only limit was the watchdog wrapped around the whole ingest step, and when that fired it killed the ingest outright, so none of the recovery above could happen — which is exactly what the reported 63MB PDF hit after 45 minutes. Conversions now have their own time limit set just inside the watchdog's, so running long ends as a normal failure and the book is imported in its original format instead of disappearing. Raising **Ingest Timeout** in CWA Settings raises both.

  Two smaller things from the same report. The log now names the folder it keeps the copy in, `/config/processed_books/failed/`, where before it said only "failed backup" — a copy existed, but not where. And when a conversion overran, the service claimed the app "should have timed out internally", which was misleading advice about a limit that did not exist; it now points at the setting that does control it. Reported by [@auspex](https://github.com/auspex) ([#1094](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1094)).

- **Opening your library no longer runs the same search twice.** Every visit to the library asked the server for the first page of books, then immediately asked for it again at a different size and threw the first answer away. Nothing looked wrong — the wasted answer never reached the screen — but on a large library that first page is the slowest query on it, and it was being run twice on every load, for every reader. The grid now waits until it knows how many columns it has before asking, so the page is fetched once ([#1144](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1144)).

- **Book pages no longer scroll sideways on a phone when a book carries long subject tags.** Libraries catalogued with Library-of-Congress subject headings — "France -- History -- Revolution, 1789-1799 -- Fiction" and the like — carry tags wider than a phone screen, and the tag row would not break one onto a second line, so the whole book page could be dragged sideways. It hit anyone reading without an editor account, guests included, because the editing view already wrapped its tags. Long tags now wrap ([#1170](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1170)).

- **The series line on a book cover is dark enough to read again.** The small series text under a title on each cover was styled with the muted grey the rest of the interface uses, and then faded a second time on top of that. The two together took it to a contrast of about 4:1 against the card, below the 4.5:1 that small text needs to stay legible, which made it hard to read for anyone whose eyesight or screen is less than ideal. The second fade is gone, so the line is the muted grey it was meant to be ([#1135](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1135)).

## [v4.1.21] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- **The reading-progress export now includes each book's identifiers, so an external tracker can match on ISBN instead of guessing from the title.** `GET /kosync/export` previously handed out only title and author, which is ambiguous for reissues, translations and common titles, and left the receiving service to guess. Every exported book now carries an `identifiers` map holding whatever Calibre has for it (ISBN, Goodreads, Amazon, and any custom types), or an empty map when the book has none. Contributed by [@Kyraminol](https://github.com/Kyraminol) ([#1092](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1092)).

### Fixed

- **Uploading a new cover now shows the new cover.** Replacing a book's cover from the edit page appeared to do nothing — the image on the left kept showing the old one, so it looked like the upload had failed even though it had worked. The cover lives at a fixed address, so the browser kept serving the copy it already had. The preview now updates the moment the upload finishes. Reported by [@chloeroform](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/989) ([#989](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/989)).

- **On a phone, the Edit button no longer sits on top of "Read now" on a book cover.** The label was clipped to "Read no…" because the pencil overlapped its tail — 52 pixels of it, on both phone and tablet widths. Both controls are permanently visible on a touch screen, so this was what every phone user saw rather than a hover quirk. The label now keeps clear of the button at every width, and cards you can't edit still centre it as before. Reported by [@Andrew-H2O](https://github.com/Andrew-H2O) ([#1112](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1112)).
- **Search engines are now told not to index your library.** `robots.txt` pointed at a file that had never existed, so every install answered "not found" — inherited from upstream Calibre-Web, where it is also missing. A crawler that gets no answer falls back to its own rules and indexes whatever it can reach, which on a server with guest browsing enabled is your catalogue, and by extension what the people using it read. The server now returns a policy that asks crawlers to stay out. If you deliberately want your library indexed, put your own `robots.txt` next to `app.db` in the config folder and it will be used instead — no rebuild, and it survives upgrades ([#1104](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1104)).

- **Books you email with "Send to Reader" now sync your reading position.** If you send books to your e-reader by email rather than downloading them, KOReader would push your progress and the server would quietly drop it — the position was saved but never attached to the book, so the library showed nothing and the log said `No book found for checksum`. The same book fetched over OPDS synced fine, which made it look like a device problem. The cause was on our side: the server recognises a book by fingerprinting the exact file it hands out, and it fingerprinted downloads but never the copy it emailed — which, with metadata embedding on, is a different file. Emailed books are now registered the same way downloads are, under both content and filename matching. Reported by [@uschi1](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/627) ([#627](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/627)).
- **The quick tag box on a book page now suggests tags you already use.** Adding a tag from the book page offered no suggestions, so it was easy to type "sci-fi" once and "Sci-Fi" the next time and end up with two tags meaning the same thing — which is exactly what two people asked for after the full editor got suggestions and this field didn't. It now offers matching tags as you type, skips the ones the book already has, and still lets you type something new. Arrow keys move through the list, Enter picks, Escape closes. Reported by [@magdalar](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/741) ([#741](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/741), [#572](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/572)).

- **When KOReader says "Server push failed", the server now records why.** Highlight sync gives the reader one message and no detail, and the server was writing nothing at all about it — a rejected push, a book it couldn't match, and a highlight it declined to store all left the log completely empty, so there was no way to tell them apart from the outside. Two of those cases even answered "success", which meant the reader reported the sync as fine while nothing had been saved. Every highlight sync now leaves a line naming the book and what happened to it — how many highlights were stored, deleted or dropped, and for a refusal, which field was wrong. Anyone chasing a highlight-sync problem can now get the answer from `docker logs`. Reported by [@iroQuai](https://github.com/iroQuai) ([#920](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/920)).

- **Guests can open and read books again.** On a server with anonymous browsing enabled, a visitor who clicked "Read" got an error page in the classic view and was bounced back to the home page in the new interface — no book, no explanation. Three separate faults stacked up on that one click: the classic reader crashed before it could render, the new interface mistook "this visitor is a guest" for "this visitor's session expired" and signed them out, and the reader then waited forever for personal settings a guest never has. All three are fixed, and a guest now reads with the default appearance while signed-in readers keep their saved theme, font and position. Reported by [@bentsea](https://github.com/bentsea) ([#1074](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1074)).

- **Author names in the reading-progress export no longer come out with a stray `|` where a comma belongs.** An author stored in Calibre as "William H. Keith, Jr." was exported as "William H. Keith| Jr.", because Calibre escapes a comma inside a single author name and `GET /kosync/export` handed the stored form out unchanged. Any service ingesting the export was matching against a name no catalogue lists. The rest of the app already un-escaped it; the export now does too.

- **Firefox no longer draws permanent scrollbars down the side of the page.** Firefox 153 changed how it treats one of the scrollbar rules the app was using, and the effect landed the day people updated: bars that used to fade away when you stopped scrolling became fixed, always-on, and squeezed the content beside them. In the new interface that hit the sidebar and the Discover row; the classic theme had the same thing on both columns of every page. Both are fixed — the app now describes scrollbars using the standard properties, so Firefox goes back to its own fading scrollbars, and the slim dark styling is unchanged in other browsers. Reported by [@chloeroform](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1089) ([#1089](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1089)).

- **Adding the library to an iPhone or iPad home screen now gives you the app icon instead of a screenshot of the page.** Every page offered iOS an `.ico` file as its home-screen icon, and described it as a size that file does not contain. iOS cannot use an `.ico` there, so it gave up and used a thumbnail of whatever page you happened to be on. The correctly sized icon had been sitting in the app unused the whole time; every page now points at it, and the same fix applies to the new interface and to servers running behind a reverse proxy on a sub-path.

### Removed

- **The two leftover app icons that nothing used are gone.** `cps/static/icon.png` and `icon.svg` were the icons used before `favicon.ico` replaced them, and nothing had pointed at them since. They were still being shipped in every release, so every download carried about 29 KB of files no browser ever asked for. Reported by [@chloeroform](https://github.com/chloeroform) ([#1095](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1095)).

### Changed

- **The Russian interface is now complete — the last two English strings are translated.** The "Support Calibre-Web NextGen" link added to the user menu in v4.1.20 was the only text left untranslated in Russian, so it showed in English next to an otherwise fully Russian menu. Russian is now the only language in the app with every string translated and nothing falling back to English. Contributed by [@standhaftsohnsergius](https://github.com/standhaftsohnsergius) ([#1088](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1088)).

## [v4.1.20] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **The classic interface now has a way to support the project.** There was no link anywhere in the classic UI — only the new interface had one — so anyone who wanted to chip in had to go looking for it. There is now a "Support Calibre-Web NextGen" entry in the user menu, in both the default and caliBlur themes.

### Fixed

- **The new UI no longer signs you out when a request doesn't make it through.** Clicking between shelves could spin and then drop you on the sign-in page, and signing back in didn't help for long — "remember me" included. The new UI treated any request that failed to reach the server as proof your session had expired, and it responded by ending the session for real, so one dropped request on a busy or slow server logged you out for good. It now checks whether you're actually still signed in before doing anything, and a request that simply didn't get through is reported as an error instead. Sessions that genuinely have expired still return you to the sign-in page as before. Reported by [@mrfearless](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1067) ([#1067](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1067)).
- **The edit page no longer jumps around when you rate a book.** On the new UI's edit page, the Languages field was 8 pixels wider while a book was unrated and snapped back the moment you clicked a star, so the row visibly shifted every time the rating changed. The stars now take the same space in both states. Reported by [@KucharczykL](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1064) ([#1064](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1064)).
- **Star ratings can be set again on the new UI's edit page.** Clicking a star did nothing on an unrated book, and wiped the rating on a book that already had one — so there was no way to rate a book from the editor at all. Clicking now sets the rating you aimed at (half-stars included), and it saves with the rest of the form. Reported by [@KucharczykL](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1061) ([#1061](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1061)).
- **Faster startup on large libraries.** On a big library the container could sit for several minutes on boot before the app came up — the startup step that locates your library and settings database scanned every file under `/config` and `/calibre-library` on each start. It now checks the usual location first and only falls back to a full scan when a database isn't where it's expected, so most installs boot in seconds. Diagnosed and first patched by [@chloeroform](https://github.com/chloeroform) ([#1022](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1022), [#1075](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1075)).

### Changed

- **The new UI now reads fully in Russian.** The duplicate-scan controls added in v4.1.19 and the annotation-sync task labels had no Russian translation yet, so Russian users saw those in English. They are now translated, along with a spelling correction in the Kobo delete warning. Contributed by [@standhaftsohnsergius](https://github.com/standhaftsohnsergius) ([#1058](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1058)).
- **Brazilian Portuguese now covers the new UI.** Large parts of the new interface — the cover picker, smart shelves, search filters and the sign-in screen — had no Brazilian Portuguese translation and fell back to English. 106 of those strings are now translated, and the smart-shelf button reads "Criar estante inteligente" so it matches the word used for shelves everywhere else. Contributed by [@pedronora](https://github.com/pedronora) ([#1072](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1072)).

## [v4.1.19] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **The new UI now reads in Brazilian Portuguese.** Around 120 strings added in recent releases had no pt-BR translation yet, so Brazilian Portuguese users saw them in English — reading progress, the cover picker, the account and profile actions, and most of the task and error messages. All of them are now translated, along with a handful of corrections to existing wording. Contributed by [@pedronora](https://github.com/pedronora) ([#1021](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1021)).

- **The container no longer re-installs Calibre on every start.** Each boot ran a Calibre installation step, on a container that already had Calibre in it — about 12 seconds of a one-minute startup on the hardware where this was reported, roughly two on a fast machine. The binaries did ship in the image; what was missing were the shortcuts that let the startup check find them, so the check failed and the install ran again. Those shortcuts are now built into the image, the check passes, and the step finishes in well under a second. Nothing about how Calibre itself works changes, and the step still repairs an image that turns up without them. Reported and originally patched by [@chloeroform](https://github.com/chloeroform) ([#875](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/875), [#1014](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1014)).

### Added

- **Smart shelves can be marked for Kobo sync from the new UI.** Ordinary shelves have had an "Enable Kobo sync" button on the shelf page since the new UI arrived; smart shelves did not, so the only way to set it was to open the rule editor and re-save the whole shelf. The button is now on the smart-shelf page too, next to Edit and Duplicate. It appears when your server has Kobo sync on and an admin has enabled "Sync Magic Shelves to Kobo", so it never shows up as a control that cannot do anything. Reported by [@auspex](https://github.com/auspex) ([#867](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/867), [#870](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/870)).

### Fixed
- **You can run a duplicate scan from the new UI again, and the Admin panel's duplicate entry now opens the settings.** The new interface had no way to start a duplicate scan at all: the button lives on the classic duplicates page, which the new one replaces, and the empty "a full scan is needed" notice told you to run it from CWA settings — a page that has no such button. The Duplicates page now has its own "Scan for duplicates" button that starts the scan in the background and tells you when it's queued. Separately, the Admin panel's "Duplicate Books" row opened the same page as the sidebar link, so it did nothing new; it now opens the duplicate-detection settings, where the matching rules, scan schedule and automatic-resolution options are. Reported by [@auspex](https://github.com/auspex) ([#1048](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1048)).

- **Anonymous browsing works again in the new UI.** With "Enable Anonymous Browsing" turned on, visitors were still stopped by a sign-in screen and could not reach the library at all — the classic view let them straight in, so the only way round it was to switch back. The new UI asked the server who you were, the server refused to answer for a guest, and the UI took that as "not allowed in" even though every other request would have been served. Guests now reach the library, and the account menu offers them a Sign in link instead of a sign-out and an account page they could not open. Sites without anonymous browsing enabled are unaffected and still require a login. Reported by [@bentsea](https://github.com/bentsea) ([#1023](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1023), [#1045](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/1045)).

- **Library sorting no longer merges distinct letters in Russian, Ukrainian, Greek and Japanese libraries.** A recent diacritic fix stripped accent marks from every alphabet, so Й and И, Ї and І, ά and α, and が and か each collapsed into a single letter in the book list, the A–Z filter and OPDS feeds. Accent folding now applies only to Latin text. ([#521](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/521))

- **Smart-shelf pages now warn you when a Kobo-sync mark isn't doing anything.** Marking a shelf for Kobo sync has no effect while your account is still set to sync your whole library to the device. Ordinary shelves already explained this; smart shelves didn't. The same note, and its one-click "Sync only my selected shelves" button, now appear on the smart-shelf page too. Originally reported by [@auspex](https://github.com/auspex) ([#866](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/866)).

- **The web interface no longer checks for duplicate books every 2.5 seconds, all day, on every open tab.** Any page you left open kept asking the server whether duplicates had been found — around 1,400 requests an hour per tab, on a library where nothing was happening. It filled up reverse-proxy logs and did needless work on the server. The check now runs when a page loads, when you come back to a tab, and while a duplicate scan is actually running (backing off as the scan goes on) — and stops as soon as there is nothing left to wait for. The duplicates badge and notification still appear on their own when a scan finishes. Reported by [@blurrycontour](https://github.com/blurrycontour) ([crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated#1288](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/issues/1288)), with a patch proposed by [@budget-coder](https://github.com/budget-coder) ([#1018](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1018)).

- **KOReader highlight syncs no longer say "Server push failed", and the whole server no longer freezes while a highlight is sent to Hardcover.** With "Sync Kobo annotations to Hardcover" turned on, every highlight in a book was sent to Hardcover one at a time while your device waited, and the server stopped answering *anything* — other people's page loads included — for about ten seconds per highlight. A book with a few highlights blew past the reader plugin's own time limit, so the device reported a failure for a sync the server had actually saved, and long freezes could make the container's own health check give up and restart it. Highlights are now saved and confirmed to your device immediately, and the Hardcover half runs in the background, where a slow or unreachable Hardcover can't hold anything up. Measured on the same machine: sending three highlights went from 30.2s to 0.13s, and an unrelated page load during that sync from 29.0s to 0.01s. Reported by [@iroQuai](https://github.com/iroQuai) ([#920](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/920), [#699](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/699)).

- **Kobo sync no longer occasionally un-downloads books from a magic shelf and takes your highlights with them.** If you sync only selected shelves and one of them is a magic shelf, a book you already had on the device could sometimes come back with the download arrow on it; re-downloading it lost the annotations and highlights you had made. The sync was working out which books belong to a magic shelf by loading each book's full record, and if the library database happened to be mid-rewrite at that moment — which the automatic ingest does routinely — a few books quietly failed to load and were treated as "no longer on the shelf", so they were archived off the device. Shelf membership is now read from the shelf's own book list, which does not depend on the library database being readable at that instant. Reported by [@TheDarkSpock](https://github.com/TheDarkSpock) and [@bigbold1023](https://github.com/bigbold1023) ([crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated#1307](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/issues/1307)).

## [v4.1.18] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Export all your KOReader reading progress as JSON.** A new read-only endpoint, `GET /kosync/export`, returns every book you have reading progress for — Calibre book id, title, authors, percentage, and when you started and last updated it — so you can feed your progress into another service (for example a unified media tracker). It authenticates the same way as the other KOReader sync endpoints (HTTP Basic, app passwords supported) and only ever returns your own progress, limited to books you're allowed to see. Example: `curl -u 'user:APP_PASSWORD' https://your-instance/kosync/export`. Contributed by @Kyraminol (#978).

### Changed

- **The new UI is fully translated into Russian again.** A dozen strings added in recent releases had no Russian yet, so Russian users saw them in English — among them the account and Kobo shelf-sync settings, the format picker and converter, and the "Something went wrong" error screen. All of them now read in Russian. Contributed by [@standhaftsohnsergius](https://github.com/standhaftsohnsergius) ([#1012](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1012)).

- **Startup logs now show where the time goes.** If your container takes a long time to come up, `docker logs --timestamps <container>` used to show long unexplained gaps, because two of the startup steps never said when they began — you couldn't tell whether a step was running slowly or hadn't started yet. The library-mount step and the web server now both announce themselves as they start, so every second of boot is attributable to a named step. Reported and originally patched by [@chloeroform](https://github.com/chloeroform) ([#1002](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1002)), while investigating slow startup for [#868](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/868).

### Fixed

- **Marking a shelf for Kobo sync now actually works — and the new UI tells you what else it needs.** Turning on "Kobo sync" for a shelf does nothing until your account is also set to sync only selected shelves; until now nothing said so, so a device would keep paging through the entire library instead of settling on the shelf. The shelf page now says it right where you make the mark, with a one-click switch and a note that books off the shelf leave the device but stay in your library. Separately, turning that account setting on used to leave your reader syncing everything anyway — the new UI skipped the step that tells the device to drop the shelves you are no longer syncing, and the step itself worked against the sync rather than with it: it quietly removed the server-side record of what your device already had, which is the only thing the next sync uses to tell the reader to let those books go. So the books stayed on the device permanently, and were hidden from your library here into the bargain. The next sync after you turn the setting on now removes exactly the books that are not on a shelf you selected, and leaves everything else — on the device and in your library — alone. Reported by [@auspex](https://github.com/auspex) ([#866](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/866)).

- **Switching a user to "sync only selected shelves" from the admin user list now takes effect properly.** Admins can flip that Kobo setting from the column in the user table as well as from the user's own settings page, but only the settings page told the reader to drop the shelves it should no longer be syncing — set from the table, the device kept every collection until someone toggled it again from the other screen. Both routes now do the same thing, whether you change one user or select several at once. Saving from the user table also tells you when a save fails instead of reporting success and quietly discarding it. Originally patched by [@Sanjays2402](https://github.com/Sanjays2402) ([#1010](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/1010)), following on from [#866](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/866).

- **A page that hits an error no longer blanks the whole new UI.** If anything went wrong while a page was drawing — a smart shelf that would not open, or a reader whose files could not be fetched after an upgrade — the new UI went completely blank. There was no message and no way back, so the only escape was to close and reopen the browser. Any such error is now caught and shown as a short "Something went wrong" screen with **Reload** and **Back to library** buttons, plus the technical detail if you want to include it in a bug report. Navigating away clears it. Reported by [@monimkxl-web](https://github.com/monimkxl-web) ([#855](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/855)).

- **Book covers no longer blend into the page.** A cover whose own artwork background happens to match your theme's background used to lose its edges and look like it was floating loose on the page. Every cover now has a thin outline in your theme's colour — in the library grid, on the book page, in the Discover and "More by this author" strips, in the table view, and in the duplicate list. Reported and originally patched by [@chloeroform](https://github.com/chloeroform) ([#987](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/987)).

## [v4.1.17] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Series name and number are back under the book covers in the new UI.** If your library is organized into series, each book card in the library, search results, and shelves now shows its series and position (for example "Dune #2") under the title and author, so you can see at a glance which series a book belongs to without opening it. The series-heavy library view already showed the position badge; this restores the series name that the classic view had. Requested by several users through the in-app feedback form ([#657](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/657)).

### Changed

- **Convert on the book edit page now offers a dropdown of valid target formats instead of a free-text box.** The control reads "Convert from [EPUB] to [MOBI]", the source list is limited to formats the configured converter can read, and the target list excludes the already-selected source.
- **Faster container startup, less disk churn.** On every boot the container was re-setting ownership across the entire application tree — around 1,800 files — which took anywhere from a couple of seconds to half a minute depending on your hardware, and on some storage back-ends copied every one of those files into the container's writable layer. The application code is read-only and already readable by everyone, so almost none of that work was needed. Startup now re-owns only the handful of folders the app actually writes to (metadata change logs and export temp), leaving the static code untouched ([#941](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/941)). Reported by @auspex and @chloeroform.

### Fixed

- **The Library remembers your sort order and read filter after a refresh.** In the new UI, changing the Library sort (for example to "Author A–Z") or the read-status filter (Unread/Read) no longer resets to the default when you reload the page — your choice is kept per browser and restored on the next visit. Series, author, and other scoped views keep their own natural ordering as before. Reported by @standhaftsohnsergius ([#640](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/640)).

- **“Read now” actions now form a straight bottom row across New UI book cards on iPad and other touch devices.** Short titles reserve the same two-line space as long ones, while shelf removal and quick edit are no longer hidden behind hover on touch hardware. Desktop keeps its uncluttered hover treatment, with keyboard focus revealing the actions. Thanks @Andrew-H2O (#863).

- **Dismissing the duplicate-scan setup notice no longer fails silently.** On a standard container, clicking to dismiss the one-time "run a full duplicate scan" notice returned a server error and the notice kept coming back, because the app tried to record the dismissal in a location it isn't allowed to write to. The dismissal is now stored on your config volume like other per-user settings, so it sticks and survives upgrades ([#992](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/992)).

## [v4.1.16] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **You can now support CWNG development from the app** — announcements queue in the top banner, and clicking anywhere on the Ko-fi message opens Ko-fi and dismisses it; dismissals are remembered. A Support on Ko-fi link is also available in the Help menu.

### Fixed

- **GitHub releases include the KOReader sync plugin again.** The
  `cwasync.koplugin.zip` download disappeared after v4.1.11 even as three plugin
  fixes shipped, so people installing from the release page could not get the
  current plugin. v4.1.16 restores the ready-to-install archive and identifies
  the bundled plugin as version 4.1.16. Thanks to @KucharczykL for flagging the
  missing asset in [#400](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/400).

- **Brazilian Portuguese now covers ~150 more of the interface.** Strings across the reader, shelves, and admin screens that still showed in English — including the "New" badge — now appear in Portuguese, and four entries that displayed the wrong text are corrected ("Shelf duplicated successfully" had been showing the message for deleting users; "Read Status" now reads "Status de leitura"). Translation work by @pedronora ([#949](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/949)).

- **Russian is now fully translated.** The last 48 English strings — renaming a tag and its error messages, smart-shelf rule failures, page-not-found and page-load errors, and the Hardcover token-file notice — now appear in Russian, and a fuzzy entry on the Hardcover notice is confirmed. Translation update by @standhaftsohnsergius ([#970](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/970)).

## [v4.1.15] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **KOReader stopped seeing new versions of the sync plugin.** If you update the
  plugin from inside KOReader — through Updates Manager or appstore.koplugin —
  the newest version it offered was the one from 13 July, even though three
  plugin fixes have shipped since: highlights and notes syncing into your
  library, highlight deletions syncing to the server, and a guard that stops a
  device deleting highlights it never had. The plugin releases those tools read
  had quietly stopped being published, so the fixes were in the server but never
  reached the device. The current plugin is published now, and publishing it is
  no longer a manual step that can be missed. If you install the plugin by
  downloading it from your own server's KOReader page, nothing changed for you —
  that copy was always current. Thanks to @KucharczykL for spotting it and to
  @filiporlo for #400.

- **Books with two or more authors were hard to read in the new UI.** Authors were separated
  with a comma — but an author's name can contain a comma itself ("Dumas, Alexandre"), so
  two authors came out as "Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste" and you could not tell where
  one person ended and the next began. Authors are now separated with "&", the same way the
  classic interface, Calibre itself, and the new UI's own edit box ("Authors (separate with
  &)") have always done it — so the book page, the library grid and the table view now agree
  with the edit form instead of contradicting it. Tags, languages and publishers are
  unaffected and still use commas. Thanks to @chloeroform for the report.

- **New accounts ignored the default theme you picked in Admin.** Whichever theme an admin
  chose under Admin → Theme, some new accounts still started on Dark. Which accounts
  depended on how they signed up: people who registered themselves through the new UI got
  it wrong only on servers upgraded from an older build, while accounts created by OAuth,
  LDAP import, or an external/proxy login always got Dark no matter what you had set —
  those three still carried a hardcoded default from back when Light was removed, and were
  never updated when the six themes returned. Admin-created accounts were always fine, so
  the same setting could produce two different results on one server. All seven ways an
  account can be created now seed the theme you configured.

- **"Change cover" made the whole server unreachable until it finished.** Opening the
  cover picker on one book froze every other page for everyone using the server — up to
  about 12 seconds, however long the slowest metadata source took to answer. The same
  freeze hit the "Search metadata" button on the edit page. Measured on a test library: a
  book page that normally answers in 30ms took 11.4 seconds while a cover search ran; it
  now answers in well under a quarter second, and the cover search itself is no slower.
  Thanks to @darkmatterpelican for reporting it in #954.

- **Setting a default library view turned your library into the search page.** After saving
  a default view, the library home showed the "Advanced search" form pinned above the books,
  the page was retitled "Advanced search", and the library heading, its actions and the
  Discover strip disappeared. Your library now stays your library — it simply shows the
  books your default view selects, with a note saying so and a "Show all books" link to see
  everything again. Reported by @chloeroform.

- **Automatic duplicate resolution never ran if you set a cooldown.** Turning on the
  cooldown ("wait N minutes between automatic resolutions") stopped automatic duplicate
  resolution from running at all, and the log reported a wait of about four hours
  counting up rather than down. Two separate causes: the cooldown you typed was thrown
  away and replaced with one minute, and the clock comparison mixed your local time with
  UTC, so the wait never elapsed. If your server runs east of UTC the opposite happened —
  the cooldown was ignored and resolution ran on every scan. Both are fixed and your
  existing resolution history stays intact. Thanks to @jdbway, who diagnosed both causes
  and pinpointed the exact lines in #944.

- **Startup no longer sets permissions on your Calibre library twice.** Every container
  start walked the whole library once from a hardcoded list and again from `dirs.json`,
  and re-walked a folder inside `/config` that had already been covered. Each folder is
  now visited once, which shortens startup on large libraries. Thanks to @chloeroform for
  spotting it in the startup log and measuring it.

- **Russian screen readers announced the reader's progress as "Прочитано: 45% r"** — a
  stray letter left over from the English "read". It only ever reached people using a
  screen reader, since the text is spoken rather than drawn on screen. Brazilian
  Portuguese was already correct and is unchanged.

## [v4.1.14] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **You can now hide books from your personal library in the new interface without deleting them or affecting anyone else.** Hide/Unhide lives beside Delete on book details, and View settings can reveal clearly marked hidden books whenever you want one back. The feature is on by default for new installations; upgrades preserve the admin's existing **Allow users to hide books** switch, which is the kill switch to check if Hide is absent.

### Fixed

- Translated entity pages now say “Show all authors/tags/…” in the signed-in
  user's language instead of leaking the English route segment, and locale-
  sensitive search labels now lowercase using the app language rather than the
  browser's language. Most-downloaded lists also remain usable for libraries
  large enough to exceed SQLite's single-query parameter limit.

- Brazilian Portuguese users now see more of the New UI in Portuguese,
  including book actions, upload feedback, favorites, and hide/archive status;
  stale catalog entries and misleading action/toast wording were corrected
  during adoption. Translation update by @pedronora (#865).

- Russian users now see the newly added New UI controls, smart-shelf date
  filters, theme choices, upload flow, and accessibility announcements in
  Russian instead of English fallback text. Translation update by
  @standhaftsohnsergius (#895), with terminology corrections during adoption.

- New UI translation updates no longer manufacture fuzzy guesses that look
  complete but disappear at runtime. Legacy SPA guesses are now an explicit
  untranslated review queue, an all-locale gate prevents fuzzy entries from
  returning, and reviewed French, Russian, German, and Hungarian navigation,
  shelf, status, error, and accessibility text now renders in those languages.
  Built-in smart-shelf names also follow the signed-in user's language without
  renaming the shelf (#879, #886).

- Hardcover setup no longer hides token status behind a disabled sync switch,
  points secret-file users at the wrong environment variable, or shows two
  conflicting enable checkboxes. One server-wide switch now controls both
  reading-progress sync and scheduled Hardcover ID fetching, existing enabled
  installations are preserved during migration, and compose deployments can
  manage it with `HARDCOVER_SYNC_ENABLED`. Startup logs report enabled/token
  presence and their sources without exposing the token. ([#897](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/897), [#898](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/898), [#899](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/899), [#900](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/900))

- **Classic catalog cards now use the same read checkbox state as book details:**
  checked means read and empty means unread, while the tooltip still names the
  action clicking will perform. Thanks @darkmatterpelican for the cache-free,
  list-versus-detail reproduction (#771).

- **Dismissing the classic-view “Try the new UI” banner now keeps it dismissed
  after updates.** It is a one-time adoption cue, not a What's New notice, so a
  previous version-specific dismissal is migrated to one durable browser choice.
  Thanks @darkmatterpelican (#907).

- **Advanced server settings now say before you click that they open in the
  classic view.** Those deep configuration pages intentionally remain in the
  proven server-rendered interface during the hybrid cutover; the New UI no
  longer makes that transition look accidental. Thanks @HLRobius (#909).

- **Series, tag, author, publisher, and language pages now put their real name
  in the browser tab.** Direct links previously captured the `…` loading state
  before the entity query finished and never refreshed it. Thanks
  @chloeroform (#892).

- **Tags can now be renamed from their New UI page.** Editors previously reached
  a read-only tag page with no rename action; the corrected name now updates the
  shared tag in the library and every linked book. Thanks @chloeroform (#914).

- **Signing in through the new interface now opens the requested page instead of showing “This page doesn't exist here.”** Password and magic-link logins honor safe same-site destinations, fall back to the library when no destination was supplied, preserve reverse-proxy subpaths, and reject links that try to send the browser to another site.

- **Syncing highlights from a second KOReader device no longer wipes the
  highlights from your first one.** Opening a book on another device could
  silently delete every highlight the other device had made, permanently and
  with no error — a later sync never brought them back. Deleting a highlight on
  a device still removes it everywhere, which is what this path is for; the
  device now says which highlights the user deleted instead of the server
  guessing from what a sync left out. Caught before release, so no published
  version ever shipped it (#920).

- **Deleting a KOReader highlight now actually syncs.** The fix released for
  this in v4.1.13 never reached the server: the plugin set the field, but its
  request spec did not list it, so it was dropped before the request was sent
  and the deleted highlight stayed in your library. Update the plugin to
  4.1.14 (Highlight sync → the plugin ships with this release) for device
  deletions to sync (#905, #906).
- Admin → Theme no longer says "Settings saved." and then changes nothing. The
  picker stored its choice in an old numbering the theme system stopped reading,
  so "Light" always came back dark. It is now the default theme for **new
  accounts**, it offers every theme (System, Light, Dark, Sepia, High contrast,
  Midnight) instead of just two, and a "Light" you saved earlier is honoured
  rather than discarded. Your own theme stays where it belongs, under Account →
  Theme. Thanks @auspex for reporting it and pushing back when the first fix
  missed the part you filed about.

- KOReader progress now appears on both classic and new book pages even when
  the book already had a read/unread record before its first matched sync. The
  devices could exchange positions while the web page showed no “KOReader
  Progress” entry because that existing-row path never created the separate
  bookmark state the pages display. This is a server-side fix; no device plugin
  update is required. Reported and carefully re-tested by @uschi1 (#627).

- **Signing out no longer drops a browser that prefers the New UI onto the
  classic login page.** The anonymous login state now honors the same durable,
  per-browser interface choice as the signed-in library, while new browsers,
  non-HTML clients, disabled-SPA instances, and reverse-proxy subpaths keep
  their existing behavior. Thanks to @iroQuai for reporting the logout gap
  after the separate #807 login-label fix. ([#908](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/908))

- The classic smart-shelf editor now actually offers working “In the past N
  days” and “Not in the past N days” choices for Publication Date and Date
  Added. Both editors now read the same rule schema, preventing fields and
  operators from silently drifting apart again. Reported by @Glennza1962
  ([#467](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/467)).
- KOReader: deleting a highlight on your device now removes it from Calibre-Web
  NextGen too. Previously the highlight stayed in the book's highlights list
  forever, however many times you synced. Reported by @iroQuai (#905). Update the
  NextGen Progress Sync plugin on your device to pick this up.

## [v4.1.13] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Metadata searches for English and Dutch books can now find Goodreads and bol.com results after you opt in to their clearly labeled best-effort providers.** Both are off by default, require no API key, use hard request timeouts, and leave other enabled sources working if either website blocks a request or changes its pages. ([#303](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/303), [#315](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/315))

- Platform-specific install and switch guides now cover Synology, Unraid, Portainer, TrueNAS SCALE, QNAP, Dockge, and Docker Compose, with verified first-run screenshots, safer migration guidance, and matching generated-wiki pages. Contributor documentation now also explains the supported local-development workflow and pull-request quality checks. ([#527](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/527), [#843](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/843), [#765](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/765))
- Book details and the sortable table now show when each book was added and last modified, restoring metadata that was only visible in the classic interface. ([#878](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/878))
- Libraries that need a standing filter—such as hiding comics by tag—can now save any advanced search as the account's default library view, with the choice following the user across devices and a one-click way to clear it. ([#498](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/498))
- KOReader highlights and notes from the open book can now sync into Calibre-Web NextGen, survive concurrent updates from multiple devices, and appear in the existing Highlights list on the book page. ([#699](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/699))

### Changed

- Editors can now correct a book title directly in the sortable table with keyboard-friendly Save/Cancel controls, while viewers retain a read-only table. ([#783](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/783))
- The new in-browser reader now keeps font family, size, margins, line height, and page theme with your account, so your preferred reading layout follows you between browsers and the classic/new interfaces; its appearance panel is touch- and keyboard-accessible on phones and desktops.
- Book grids can now load a chosen number of complete rows at any card density, Discover respects the server's random-book count, and touch-screen “Read now” actions align along the bottom of each card.

### Fixed

- The Fetch Metadata window's Keys panel now shows Hardcover as "Configured" when the token comes from the `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` environment variable or a `HARDCOVER_TOKEN_FILE` secret, instead of claiming no key was set. Searches worked the whole time — only the badge was wrong, which made a working setup look broken. ([#896](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/896))
- Hardcover auto-fetch now records what each run did, so the Stats & Activity page's Hardcover section shows the books processed and matched instead of staying blank. Runs still finished their work before, but every one of them logged "Error saving stats to database" and saved nothing. ([#876](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/876))
- Changing one classic-reader appearance control no longer erases the user's other saved reader settings.
- The classic book page's favorite star now changes immediately after a click instead of waiting for a reload, because object-shaped action responses no longer crash the shared flash-message handler. ([#880](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/880))
- Smart-shelf moving date windows are now available in the new interface's rule builder—not only the classic builder—with Publication Date and Date Added fields and day-based operators. ([#467](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/467))
- Reload metadata now reads PDF, FB2, comic, audio, EPUB, and KEPUB files instead of failing through an EPUB-only path, and applies only the details a file actually contains — a book whose file carries no title or author keeps the title and authors you curated instead of being renamed after its filename. Editors can also run it from the new book page. ([#877](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/877))
- Uploading a PDF now picks up the author recorded inside the file. PDFs without an XMP block — most of them — previously imported as "Unknown" even when the file said who wrote it. ([#877](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/877))

## [v4.1.12] - 2026-07-13

- **Newly imported books now sync KOReader progress immediately in filename-matching mode.** A book added after server startup could report “No book found” until it was downloaded once or the server restarted, leaving progress detached from the web UI and other devices. Both document identities are now registered as part of ingest. ([#509](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/509), [#627](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/627))
- **A replaced side-loaded book no longer stays duplicated in a Kobo's My Books list after the old copy is deleted.** Hard-delete sync now uses the full archive/removal response Kobo firmware honors, while preserving official Kobo-store sync responses and hiding the dead entry from Archive. ([#832](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/832))

### Added

- **Mobile libraries can show two, three, or four complete covers per row instead of spending the whole screen on one book.** Library View settings now offer Comfortable, Compact, and Dense layouts, remember the choice in that browser, and use more of wide desktop screens without cropping cover art. ([#835](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/835), [#764](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/764))
- **Series pages no longer force every book into the cover grid.** A keyboard- and touch-accessible grid/list switch provides a more readable alternative and remembers the choice. ([#662](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/662))

### Changed

- **Long tag collections no longer push a book's description several screens down on mobile.** Book details now keep the cover and useful title information together, collapse tags after the first eight behind an accessible Show all control, and show synced reading position as a semantic progress bar. ([#836](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/836))
- **Magic-link and SSO choices no longer stretch the login page into separate sections.** Every configured method now appears in one compact “Login with” row, including all enabled providers under their configured display names. ([#833](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/833))

### Fixed

- **High-resolution Amazon covers remain available when the Amazon metadata provider is turned off.** The cover picker now uses a book's stored ISBN to offer the high-resolution image independently, so unreliable Amazon metadata can stay disabled without losing the cover source. Thanks to @briffaantoine for identifying the missing configuration path. ([#304](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/304))
- **Russian and French no longer fall back to English across several new-interface menus.** Data-driven sidebar, Admin, filter, and sort labels now enter the translation catalogs just like directly translated text; Russian gains the remaining menu translations, French gains the library/search/sort translations reported in #615, and the classic database troubleshooting guide is now translatable. Credit: @standhaftsohnsergius (#844). Addresses [#719](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/719) and [#615](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/615).
- **A hidden Table view can be restored without switching back to the classic interface.** Customize navigation now includes the same server-backed “Show book list” setting that controls the Table link. ([#837](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/837))
- **The new book page shows the real imported filename again instead of losing it—or showing an internal timestamp/random staging prefix after a browser upload.** Uploads now carry the browser-selected name explicitly through ingest, and the SPA displays that stored name as “Imported as.” ([#840](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/840))
- **Reloading metadata now refreshes stale EPUB/PDF/other format sizes too.** The refresh rechecks every real file on disk and persists changed sizes, so a conversion or external replacement no longer leaves an obsolete size blocking Send to eReader. ([#841](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/841))
- **Shelf actions no longer push the page wider than a 375 px phone screen.** Rename, visibility, Kobo, reorder, and delete controls now wrap inside the shelf instead of creating horizontal scrolling.

## [v4.1.11] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **The most-requested Light design is here, as part of a complete per-account theme system.** Open **Account → Theme** in the new interface to choose **System** (follows `prefers-color-scheme` and switches live with your device), **Light**, **Dark**, **Sepia**, **High contrast**, or **Midnight** (true-black for OLED screens). The choice applies instantly, belongs to your account rather than the whole server, and survives reloads, signing out and back in, and server restarts. Light and Dark hold across the whole SPA — library, book details, editor, Admin, dialogs, status messages, and reader chrome — with WCAG 2.2 AA contrast; High contrast goes further for low-vision reading. Thanks to @uschi1 and @auspex for pushing this to the top of the list ([#351](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/351), [#736](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/736)).
- **Admins can reset another user's password without leaving the new UI.** Eligible user cards now offer a confirmed, admin-only reset that generates the replacement on the server and emails it to the user's existing address; the browser never receives the password, non-admin/Guest/self targets are rejected, and a mail-queue failure leaves the old password usable. ([#745](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/745))
- **Readable books now have a one-click Read now action on their grid card.** It opens EPUB/KEPUB in the new reader and supported PDF, comic, text, and audio formats in their in-browser reader, while the main card still opens book details. The action is always visible on touch screens and fully named for keyboard and screen-reader users. ([#653](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/653))
- **Smart shelves can now use moving date windows such as “in the past 28 days.”** Publication Date and Date Added rules support both “In the past N days” and its inverse, so a shelf for the past four weeks or six months keeps itself current instead of freezing a date into the rule. Invalid, empty, negative, and excessively large windows are rejected safely. ([#467](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/467))
- **The new book page now shows Calibre custom columns such as Pages.** Every displayable custom field shown on the classic detail page is carried into the redesigned page with its correct type and formatting, while ignored fields and the configured read-status column stay private/unduplicated. Zero and “No” values are preserved instead of disappearing. ([#767](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/767))
- **Admins can edit the send-to-eReader email body from the new Account page.** The redesigned page already exposed the recipient and subject but omitted the classic global message-body template. Admin accounts now get the missing localized textarea; non-admin accounts cannot read or change the server-wide template. ([#834](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/834))
- **Basic Configuration now shows whether the active Hardcover token is present, accepted, and expiring.** A rejected token no longer requires log archaeology: the admin page distinguishes missing, valid, rejected/expired, and temporarily unverifiable states, and shows the expiry when the token provides one. ([#838](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/838))

### Changed

- **Upload is now a distinct Library action instead of another identical sidebar row.** Accounts allowed to add books get a clearly named, touch-sized Upload books button in the Library toolbar on desktop and mobile; direct `/upload` bookmarks still work. Admin also has one conventional home in the account menu instead of a duplicate sidebar link. ([#664](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/664), [#722](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/722))
- **Customize navigation no longer dominates the top of the sidebar.** The oversized glass capsule has become a quiet, touch-sized footer control beside the navigation it changes, while the existing keyboard/touch reorder flow, focus restoration, reset, and status announcements remain intact. ([#714](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/714))
- **The Library no longer shows two search boxes that do the same thing.** Simple search now lives in the top bar on desktop and its focused search row on mobile; the Library still keeps Advanced Search for richer filters, and the top-bar field stays synchronized with deep links and browser back/forward navigation. ([#723](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/723))
- **Books without a cover now show a clean Calibre-Web NextGen placeholder instead of the old logo card.** Coverless books used to display a generic dark logo image that looked out of place — especially on the new Light and Sepia themes. In the new interface they now get a tasteful typographic cover (the book's title and author on a card that matches your theme); the classic interface, OPDS, and Kobo get a refreshed NextGen placeholder image. Real covers are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Expired reverse-proxy sessions now return you to the login page instead of a dead screen, and Sign out logs you out of your proxy too.** With Authelia/OIDC/oauth2-proxy in front of the app, leaving the new UI open until the login session expired showed a "Failed to fetch" error on the next action instead of bouncing you back to the login page. And Sign out only cleared the app's own session, so a reverse proxy that ends its login on a top-level `/logout` request never saw one — you could stay signed in at the proxy. Both are fixed: any expired-session response now returns you to the login page, and Sign out makes the real top-level `/logout` request the proxy can act on (the reverse-proxy sub-path is preserved). Thanks to @auspex for the report ([#824](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/824), [#674](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/674)).
- **A theme that failed to save no longer looks as though it succeeded.** If the server rejects the change, the picker, live preview, and local reload cache now all return to the account's saved theme instead of leaving an unsaved palette active.
- **Light mode now stays visually consistent in Admin, book-card actions, the cover picker, and the EPUB reader.** Native Admin dropdowns no longer fall back to square browser-default styling, controls layered over cover art use a guaranteed-contrast backing, and the reader's toolbar follows its Light/Sepia/Dark reading surface instead of always remaining dark. Addresses [#351](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/351).
- **Shuffling the new UI's Discover picks no longer makes the Library jump up and down.** The existing cards stay in place while a fresh random set loads, then update in one step; screen readers are also told when the shuffle starts and finishes. ([#850](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/850))
- **Uploading books in the new UI now uses the browser's native, keyboard-accessible file control.** Drag-and-drop and tap-to-choose share one reliable control, repeat uploads are blocked while one is pending, and queued/rejected results are announced to assistive technology. ([#654](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/654))
- **Accented titles and names now sort with their base letters in the library, search results, the new UI, and OPDS.** `È`/`É` entries no longer fall to the end or get stranded in separate letter buckets; composed and decomposed Unicode forms agree, Spanish `Ñ` remains a distinct letter after N, and German `ß` receives `ss` primary ordering — all without adding a native collation dependency. ([#521](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/521))
- **One pathological PDF download no longer freezes every other page for up to 90 seconds.** Calibre metadata exports now run in a bounded gevent-aware thread pool, so health checks and unrelated requests remain responsive while a slow export waits; excess exports immediately serve the original file instead of building a queue. Timeout and process-tree cleanup remain intact. ([#561](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/561))
- **Book covers show the whole cover again instead of being cropped.** In the new interface, covers whose artwork isn't a standard 2:3 shape had their edges cut off to fill the card. Covers now fit the whole image inside the card (letterboxed on a matching background), and the cover picker shows the complete artwork when you're choosing between editions — the grid layout and density are unchanged. ([#660](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/660))
- **Searching after editing a book now shows the corrected details.** After you changed a book's title or author in the new UI, searching could still turn up the old value. The library now refreshes its in-memory view when you save an edit, so search reflects your change right away. ([#744](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/744))
- **You can reach your entire library, not just the first screenful.** The new library grid loaded more books only as you scrolled, and if that automatic loading didn't kick in you were stranded on the first pages. There's now a keyboard-accessible **Load more** button that stays available whenever more books remain, so the whole library is reachable however you browse. ([#704](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/704))

## [v4.1.10] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **You can delete a book from the new UI again.** The redesigned book page had no delete control, so removing a book meant switching to the classic interface. The book page now has a Delete button (shown only to accounts with the "Delete books" permission) that asks for confirmation, then removes the book and its files just like the classic view — after which you're taken back to your library with the book gone from the grid. Thanks to @Glalith121 for the report ([#803](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/803)).
- **The new UI's metadata-search dialog now has the per-provider on/off toggles.** You can turn individual metadata sources (like Hardcover) off and back on directly from the new editor, just like the classic view — the choice is saved to your account, so it's the same whichever interface you use. ([#677](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/677))
- **Book ratings can now be set with an inline five-star control in the new editor.** Click either half of a star for half-star precision, use the arrow keys to adjust in half-star steps, or clear the rating explicitly — no dropdown required. ([#779](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/779))
- **Authors, series, tags, publishers, and other browse pages now have a compact list view.** Use the grid/list toggle to switch from cards to full-width name-and-book-count rows; the choice is remembered in this browser, including on mobile. ([#697](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/697))
- **The new UI's book editor has a Publication date field again.** The redesigned editor shipped without the publication-date field the classic editor has, so the date could only be set from the classic UI. The editor now has a "Published" date input — prefilled from the book's current date, and clearable to reset it. This completes the #689 report alongside the metadata autocomplete that shipped in v4.1.9. ([#689](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/689))

### Fixed

- **The new UI's login page now shows your configured OIDC/SSO button label.** With OpenID Connect login set up, the classic login page showed your admin-set "Button label" (e.g. "Continue with Acme Identity"), but the new interface's login button showed the internal provider name ("generic") instead. The new UI now reads the same configured label the classic page does, so both surfaces show identical SSO button text. Thanks to @thelastblt for the report ([#807](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/807)).
- **Editing one book's metadata no longer floods the log with repeated "log file not found" warnings.** Saving a single metadata change could make the background cover/metadata enforcer run several times over for that one change — the first run did the work and deleted its to-do note, and every later run logged a `Log file '…' not found after 3 attempts` / `Skipping processing` warning, up to six times per save. The change detector now collapses the burst of filesystem events a single save produces into one enforcement pass (both the inotify and polling watchers share one debounce now), and the already-handled case is a single calm note instead of a stack of warnings. Thanks to @auspex for the report ([#802](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/802)).
- **Reading progress now carries over between the classic reader and the new UI's reader.** Turning pages in one reader and then opening the same book in the other could resume at the beginning or an old spot. Both readers now save your position to your account continuously (not just when you tap the bookmark button) and, on open, resume from the newest position the server has — so you can switch interfaces mid-book and pick up where you left off. Libraries upgraded from older versions are repaired automatically on startup, and your last-read position still restores offline. Thanks to @Glalith121 for the report ([#805](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/805)).
- **"Run Hardcover Auto-Fetch" now works instead of failing immediately.** Triggering the Hardcover ID auto-fetch from settings could stop right after "Found N books…" with an internal "owning session has been closed" error, because the background job set up its database connection on the wrong thread. The job now opens its connection on the thread that actually runs it, so it works through your whole library — matching books to Hardcover and queuing uncertain matches for review — without crashing. ([#821](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/821))
- **Automatic metadata fetching during ingest no longer crashes when Hardcover is configured.** When a book was imported through the ingest folder with automatic metadata fetching on and a Hardcover token set, the import could fail with an internal error because the ingest process read its configuration from a partial, hand-maintained list of settings — so a newer setting (here, the Hardcover token) was simply missing. The ingest process now loads the full configuration the same way the rest of the app does, closing that whole class of "missing setting" crash. ([#819](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/819))
- **Two people on the same server can now share one Hardcover token.** Saving a Hardcover token that another account already used could fail with an internal server error, because each token had to be unique to a single user. Sharing one token across accounts is now allowed, and existing libraries are migrated automatically on upgrade.
- **The library's default newest-first order now has regression coverage across the API and new UI.** The default uses Calibre's added/modified timestamp (not publication date), and fresh catalog/filter mounts replace stale accumulated pages before rendering. ([#753](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/753))
- **Four remaining Russian interface strings are now complete in the new UI.** Suggestions, library refresh, highlight removal, and returning to the new interface no longer appear untranslated or use a fuzzy mistranslation. ([#656](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/656))
- **KOReader sync no longer loses the furthest reading position when another device is behind.** A later push from a different device on an earlier page could overwrite the server's further position, and device-clock differences could then classify a real forward sync as backwards. The server now keeps the highest known percentage across devices and file digests, while still accepting deliberate rewinds from the same device; marking a finished book unread also clears its KOReader server position so it can be restarted. The bundled KOReader plugin uses percentage—not clock order—to decide whether a remote position is ahead. Thanks to @Glalith121 and @mueslimak3r for the detailed cross-device reports. ([#633](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/633))
- **The new UI's send-to-e-reader dialog now shows your saved e-reader address instead of an empty recipient field.** The recipient box was blank with only a "blank = your e-reader email" hint, so it looked like the address you'd saved in your account had been lost — even though sending still worked. The field is now prefilled with your saved address; type a different one to override it for that send, or clear it to fall back to the saved address. ([#715](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/715))
- **Reporting an issue from the new UI's Help menu now opens the bug-report form instead of a blank issue.** The "Report Issue on GitHub" link pointed at the blank-issue URL, so reporters landed on an empty textarea rather than the Bug report / Feature request templates defined in the repo. It now opens the issue-template chooser. Thanks to @auspex for the report ([#799](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/799)).
- **The edit pencil on a book card can now be opened in a new tab.** In the new UI, the hover edit pencil on a book card was a button rather than a real link, so ⌘/ctrl-click (or middle-click) didn't open the editor in a new tab the way real links do — there was no `href` for the browser to open. The pencil is now a true link: a plain click still opens the editor in place (no full page reload), and a modified click opens it in a new tab. Thanks to @chloeroform for the report ([#798](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/798)).
- **Hardcover metadata is fetched again when a book is auto-ingested.** After the v4.1.9 change that centralised how the Hardcover token is read, the automatic fetch that runs on ingest aborted with an internal error and skipped Hardcover — even with a `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` set — while manual "Fetch Metadata" kept working. The token is now read safely in the background ingest process, so a `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` (or `HARDCOVER_TOKEN_FILE`) in the environment is applied during ingest again. Thanks to @ghub3297 and @Glalith121 for the reports ([#819](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/819)).
- **Saving a cover for a PDF-only or other non-EPUB/AZW3 book no longer ends with a false enforcement error.** The metadata enforcer now preserves the successful cover save, refreshes the format-independent `metadata.opf` backup, and logs an informational note that only in-file embedding was skipped for the unsupported format (#797).
- **Author-sort mismatch warnings now name the affected book and link straight to where you fix it.** The warning previously omitted the book title/ID and pointed at an author-admin screen that doesn't exist, so there was no clear way to act on it. It now names the book and gives the direct edit link (`/admin/book/<id>`): opening that page and re-saving the book's Authors field regenerates its author sort and clears the warning (or you can correct the book in Calibre). Thanks to @auspex for the report (#801).
- **The classic book page's read checkbox now matches the book's actual state.** Unread books previously showed a checked box beside the “Mark As Read” action, while read books showed an empty box. The checkbox is now empty for unread and checked for read; its tooltip continues to describe what clicking will do (#771).
- **OPDS readers now have a dedicated “Currently Reading” feed.** The OPDS root previously offered only Read and Unread, forcing in-progress books into the broad not-finished group. Signed-in users can now open a feed containing exactly books in the canonical in-progress state, with the same visibility and selected-shelf restrictions as the rest of their OPDS catalog (#672).

## [v4.1.9] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **The new UI now has a Refresh library button, so a manual re-scan is one click away again.** The redesigned library page shipped without any equivalent of the classic header's "Refresh Library" action, so after dropping new files into the ingest folder there was no way to trigger a scan from the new UI — the books just didn't appear until the next automatic sweep. The library toolbar now has a refresh button that starts the background scan, shows a status line while it runs, and refreshes the grid so newly-added books show up. Thanks to the reporters (#780, #665). ([#780](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/780), [#665](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/665))
- **The new UI's book editor suggests existing tags, authors, series, publishers, and languages as you type again.** When you edit a book's metadata in the redesigned interface, each of these fields now offers a dropdown of values already in your library, so a typo no longer quietly creates a near-duplicate tag (`sci-fi` vs `scifi`) or series. Pick from the list, or keep typing to enter a brand-new value — the classic editor's autocomplete is back. Thanks to @magdalar for the report. ([#741](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/741), [#778](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/778), [#689](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/689))

### Fixed

- **The startup log no longer prints a scary "desktop integration failed" warning.** On first container start, Calibre's installer tried to register desktop menus and MIME types — pointless in a headless server image — and printed a WARNING with a traceback that made healthy startups look broken. The standard directories the step expects now exist, so it completes silently. Thanks to @darkmatterpelican for the report ([#769](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/769)).
- **The `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` environment variable now works everywhere.** Setting the Hardcover API token via the environment used to be honored by some features but ignored by others — most visibly, the Fetch Metadata panel told you to "set a Hardcover API key" even though your env token worked, and the admin page gave no hint a token was active. All features now resolve the token the same way, the admin page shows a note when an environment token is in use, and you can keep the secret out of your compose file entirely with the new `HARDCOVER_TOKEN_FILE` (docker-secrets style). Thanks to @KucharczykL for the report ([#743](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/743)).
- **OPDS feeds now show which letter or item you drilled into.** Following up on the per-feed titles added in v4.1.8: an alphabetical sub-list now shows its letter ("Alphabetical Books (U)", "Authors (V)"), and opening a specific author, category, series, publisher, rating, file format or language names it in the feed title ("Categories: Fantasy", "Ratings: 4.5 Stars", "Languages: German"). The author/category/series letter lists — which still showed only the bare server name — are fixed too. Thanks to @chloeroform for the suggestion ([#758](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/pull/758)).
- **The Admin page's configuration buttons now open in the same tab.** In the new UI, everything under "More server configuration" (Basic configuration, UI settings, Logs, Scheduled tasks, …) opened a new browser tab, piling up windows and making it look like the app had forgotten you switched to the new UI. These are in-app pages and now navigate normally. Thanks to @auspex for the report ([#738](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/738)).
- **Choosing the new UI now sticks.** Once you switch to the redesigned interface, the choice is remembered on that browser — opening the library, following a bookmark, or opening the page in a new tab lands you back in the new UI instead of silently dropping you into the classic view and showing the "Try the new UI" banner again. Switch back to classic (from the new UI's account menu) and that choice sticks too. The preference is per-browser, so other devices and other people on the server are unaffected. Thanks to @auspex for the report ([#739](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/739)).
- **New UI reader: highlights can now be removed (and recolored).** In the redesigned in-browser EPUB reader you could create a colored highlight by selecting text, but there was no way to delete one — tapping an existing highlight did nothing, so unwanted highlights piled up with no way to clear them. Tapping a highlight now opens a small menu: pick a different swatch to recolor it, or choose "Remove highlight" to delete it. Thanks to @hayvan96 for the report (#782).
- **New UI: opening a shelf no longer shows a blank screen.** On v4.1.8, clicking any shelf — a manual shelf or a smart (magic) shelf — in the new UI left the page blank, and refreshing the browser did not recover it. The main book list, authors, series and other pages were unaffected. Rolling back to v4.1.7 was the only workaround. This is fixed; shelves open and list their books again. Thanks to @mrfearless and @Gauva1n for the reports (#784).
- **Half-star ratings no longer draw a tiny star floating inside the outline.** In the new UI, a book with a half-star rating (3.5, 4.5, …) showed the fractional star as a shrunken miniature star sitting inside the empty outline on the book page. The partial star now fills cleanly from the left edge. Thanks to @KucharczykL for the report ([#776](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/776)).
- The new UI could keep showing outdated interface translations after you upgraded — for example the French read button reverting to English "Read now" and the "mark as read" toggle showing the wrong wording, even though the fix had already shipped. The interface-text file the new UI loads now refreshes whenever it changes, so an upgrade always shows the current translations (a hard browser refresh clears any that were already cached). ([#615](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/615))

### Changed

- The new UI now uses the readable System font by default for both headings and body text, instead of the bookish serif some readers found hard to read. If you prefer the old look, "Bookish Serif" is still one click away under Account → UI display/body font (it's now offered for headings too). ([#641](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/641))
- **German interface: 19 strings that showed in English now appear in German.** The OPDS catalog descriptions (for example "Books sorted by series" and "Popular publications from this catalog based on rating") and the duplicate-scan progress messages were untranslated, so German users saw English there while the rest of the UI was translated. Filled in from pending German translations contributed upstream. Thanks to @djalexz85 and @fucx (Calibre-Web-Automated) and @ManuelDrescher (calibre-web).
- **Ukrainian interface: 141 more strings now appear in Ukrainian.** Error messages, the metadata review queue, the cover/thumbnail cache tools and other panels that previously showed English for Ukrainian users are now translated. Filled in from pending Ukrainian translations contributed upstream. Thanks to @Demelja (Calibre-Web-Automated).

## [v4.1.8] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Book pages now show when you started reading and when your progress last
  synced.** If you read with Kobo or KOReader, the book page now shows both
  dates so you can see how long a book has been in progress and whether its
  reading position is current. Thanks to @Kyraminol for the contribution (#763).
- **The table view can now show a Tags column.** In the redesigned interface's
  table view, each book's tags now appear as their own column, next to Series —
  handy when you're skimming or editing metadata and want to see genres and
  subjects at a glance. Use the "Columns" button to hide it if you'd rather not.
  Thanks to @mrdynamo and the original reporter (#725).

### Fixed
- **Russian interface translation updated** with another round of corrections.
  Thanks to @standhaftsohnsergius (#740).
- **Downloads failed with a server error for apps and scripts that don't send a
  browser identifier.** Some OPDS readers, download managers, and command-line
  tools (`curl`, scripts) omit the User-Agent header. Those requests hit a
  500 error instead of the book — the download and OPDS-download endpoints
  assumed the header was always present. They now handle its absence and serve
  the file normally. Thanks to @AshayK003, who reported and fixed the same crash
  upstream (janeczku/calibre-web#3668).
- **The "duplicates found" notice no longer nags about books you've archived.**
  If you archived one book of a duplicate pair, the duplicates page correctly
  showed nothing — but the sidebar badge and the pop-up notice kept counting it,
  so clicking through led to an empty page and the notice came back on every
  refresh. The count now respects the same archived and hidden books the
  duplicates page does, so the badge and the page agree. Reported by @auspex (#737).
- **OPDS feeds now each show their own name instead of all reading as your
  library's name.** In an OPDS reader, "Read Books," "Unread Books," each shelf,
  the author and series lists, and search results all appeared with the same
  title — your instance name — so the feed list was a wall of identical entries.
  Every feed now shows "Instance - Feed Name" (a shelf shows its own name, a
  search shows the query), so readers that list feeds by title can tell them
  apart. Thanks to @chloeroform for the report (#750).
- **Parts of the new interface stayed in English even when your language was
  fully translated.** Menu items like "Table view" and "Smart shelves," and whole
  screens such as the admin settings, cover picker, advanced search, and the book
  editor, showed English in the redesigned interface while the classic view
  translated them correctly. Those strings were never being collected for
  translation, so no locale could pick them up. They are now, so they translate
  into your language as each locale's translation is filled in. Thanks to
  @standhaftsohnsergius for the detailed report (#719).
- **Author names with a comma (like "William H. Keith, Jr.") now show the comma,
  not a pipe.** In the redesigned interface, an author whose name contains a
  comma appeared under book titles as "William H. Keith| Jr." — a raw `|` where
  the comma should be. Calibre stores those commas internally as a pipe, and the
  new interface was showing the stored form instead of the display form. Book
  cards on the Library and author pages, and the book detail page, now render the
  comma correctly. Reported on Discord by neontapir (#730).
- **Automatic Hardcover matching finds the right book more often.** When
  auto-fetching Hardcover metadata, the matcher only scored the first 10 of the
  up-to-50 results the search returns, so a correct edition ranked lower down
  (Hardcover puts author-in-title hits first) could be thrown away before it was
  ever considered. It now scores the whole result set, and the manual-review
  screen's "Top N" heading matches the candidates it actually shows. Thanks to
  @Schmavery for the fix (#729).

### Changed
- **Book lists load as you scroll instead of behind a "Load more" button.** The
  Library grid, Table view, shelves, smart shelves, and advanced-search results
  now fetch and append the next page automatically as you near the bottom, so
  browsing a large library is one continuous scroll. Thanks to @kurtlieber for
  the contribution (#735).
- **Reordering your sidebar sections now feels smooth and physical.** In the
  Customize panel (the left rail's **Customize** control), dragging a section used
  to snap the other rows around with no sense of motion and could jitter or stick
  at row edges. Now the row you grab lifts and tracks your pointer while the
  others glide aside to open a gap, then it settles into its slot when you release
  — the same on mouse, touch, and pen. Keyboard reordering (focus a section's
  drag handle, then use the arrow keys) and hiding/restoring sections animate
  through the same motion, and everything falls back to instant when your system
  is set to reduce motion.

## [v4.1.7] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Book pages now show star ratings and more from the same author.** In the
  redesigned interface, a book's page now displays its star rating (matching the
  classic view), and — below the details — a "More by this author" row of other
  books by that author, so a book page is a place to keep browsing instead of a
  dead end. Books with no cover art or description no longer leave the page
  looking half-empty.

### Fixed
- **Admins can find the Admin page in the new interface again.** In the
  redesigned UI the Admin/Settings entry lived only in the left sidebar rail, so
  admins who looked in the account (avatar) menu — the usual home for
  "Settings/Admin" — saw only *My account*, *Back to the classic view* and *Sign
  out*, and some switched back to the classic interface because they couldn't
  find admin. The account menu now shows an **Admin** link (for admin accounts
  only) that opens the in-app admin page. Reported through the in-app feedback
  form (#659).
- **The bulk-edit toolbar no longer shows a raw code placeholder.** In the new
  interface, selecting several books and choosing merge or bulk-apply showed
  literal text like "Merge %(n)s books…" and "Apply to %(n)s books" instead of
  the actual count. Both now read correctly (e.g. "Merge 3 books…"). The same
  underlying issue was corrected on the book page's tag controls.
- **Downloading a book on an iPhone no longer strands you.** In the new
  interface, tapping a format to download it used to navigate Safari away from
  the app to a page it couldn't show — leaving iPhone users stuck until they
  force-restarted the app to get back. Downloads now open in a separate tab, so
  the app stays put and you land right back where you were. Reported by
  @Arjan61 (#716). Also applies to the download buttons on the edit-book screen
  and the annotation exports.
- **Russian translation corrected in the new interface.** The font-setting
  labels in the redesigned UI were untranslated, and a few strings showed the
  wrong text (the "System Sans-Serif" font option read «Статистика системы»).
  Russian now reads correctly throughout those settings. Contributed by
  @standhaftsohnsergius (#718).
- **Auto-adding metadata during import no longer skips the cover on some setups.**
  On libraries that store book files separately from `metadata.db` (the "split
  library" option), fetching metadata during ingest failed to save the downloaded
  cover and logged an internal error. Covers now apply correctly during import.
  Reported by @maraken (#709).
- **Marking a book "unread" now fully resets it.** After opening a book "just to
  test it", marking it unread cleared the reading percentage but the book could
  stay flagged as *Currently reading*. Unread now clears that state too, so the
  book reads as untouched everywhere. Reported by @uschi1 (#683).
- **Converting from formats that need a Calibre plugin works again.** Converting
  e.g. KFX→EPUB failed with "No plugin to handle input format" even with the
  plugin installed, because the converter wasn't looking in your Calibre plugins
  folder. It now does. Reported by @jhazan-jpg (#724).
- **Changing a book's cover now updates the cover inside the file.** Picking a new
  cover updated it in the library but downloads (and the "Currently embedded"
  preview) kept the old image. The new cover is now embedded into the book file.
  Reported by @GustavPersson (#707).
- **Removing a duplicate now tells your Kobo to drop the old copy.** When the
  duplicate-scanner replaced an older copy of a book with a newer one, the server
  never told a synced Kobo that the old copy was gone, so it could linger as a
  duplicate. The server now sends the removal to the device on its next sync.
  (Some Kobo devices may still keep a removed sideloaded book until it's archived
  on the device — we're improving that in a follow-up.) Reported by
  @Chronosmage-alt (#708).
- **Uploading a new format to a book no longer creates a duplicate on very long
  filenames.** An over-long uploaded filename could be imported as a separate book
  instead of being added as a format to the existing one. Reported by @jrhedman
  (#690).

## [v4.1.6] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Pick the right Hardcover edition when fetching metadata (new interface).**
  On a Hardcover search result you can now click **Editions** to drill into that
  book's individual editions (paperback, e-book, translations…) and apply the one
  you want — so the correct edition ISBN and Hardcover edition id land on your
  book, which is what Hardcover reading-progress sync needs to match the right
  copy. Every result also gets a **⋯ (View all details)** button that opens the
  full record — complete description, every tag, and each identifier on its own
  line — as a popup on desktop or a bottom sheet on mobile, so nothing is hidden
  behind the truncated preview. Requested on Discord (mgrimace, Wasabi).
- **A "What's New" page, so you can see what changed without reading a
  changelog.** The Help menu (the "?" in the top bar) now has a What's New entry
  that opens a plain-English log of recent features and fixes — newest first,
  grouped by release, each with a "Try it" link straight to the thing it
  describes. A small dot on the Help menu points it out once after an update and
  clears the moment you open it.
- **Customize your sidebar from the new interface.** A **Customize** capsule at
  the top of the left rail turns the sidebar into an editable list: drag sections
  into the order you want (for example, move **Shelves** to the top so you don't
  have to scroll) and tap the ✕ to hide the ones you don't use. Reordering works
  with the mouse, on touch, and with the keyboard, and your layout is saved to
  your account. Earlier (v4.1.4) the new UI started respecting the visibility
  settings from the classic interface; now you set both visibility and order
  without leaving the new UI. Requested by @Glennza1962 and @alva-seal (#585).

- **Choose the interface font in the new UI.** Account settings now has **UI
  body font** and **UI display font** pickers — pick System Sans-Serif, a
  bookish serif, or monospace instead of the defaults. Each option previews in
  its own font, the choice is saved to your account so it follows you across
  devices and browsers, and "Default" always returns to the theme font.
  Contributed by @kurtlieber (#701).

### Changed
- **New browser-tab icon that matches the app.** The favicon is now the amber
  book mark from the refreshed interface, on the app's dark background — so the
  tab, bookmark, and home-screen icon read as Calibre-Web NextGen instead of the
  inherited upstream icon.

### Fixed
- **Removed the stray number next to "User administration" in the new
  interface.** The admin page showed a bare, unlabeled count (e.g. "1") beside
  the title that read as a glitch rather than information. It's gone; the user
  count is already clear from the list itself. Reported by @chloeroform (#669),
  patch by @chloeroform.
- **KOReader reading position now syncs between two devices even after a book
  is re-uploaded or edited.** If one reader was ahead (say 80%) and the other
  behind (67%), the second device could refuse to jump forward — a manual pull
  just said "already synced". This happened when the two devices held slightly
  different files for the same book (a re-download after a metadata edit, a
  sideloaded copy, or a format the server didn't embed metadata into), so the
  server couldn't tell they were the same book and kept each device's position
  separate. The server now registers the fingerprint of every file it hands out
  (not only metadata-embedded downloads) and unifies a book's reading position
  across all of a book's known files, so the furthest position wins on every
  device. Reported by @Glalith121 (#633).
- **Your profile picture now shows in the new interface.** If you set a profile
  picture in the classic account settings, the new interface didn't use it — the
  account button in the top bar and the account page both showed a generic
  silhouette. Both now display your picture, and fall back to the silhouette only
  when you haven't set one. Reported by @chloeroform (#668).
- **Marking a book "unread" now clears its reading progress.** If you opened a
  book just to peek at it, it could stick at something like "0.6% read" with no
  way to reset it — the read/unread switch flipped the status but left the
  percentage behind. Marking a book unread now also resets its progress to zero
  (and clears where the in-browser reader would resume), so an unread book reads
  as untouched everywhere. Marking a book read is unchanged. Reported by
  @uschi1 (#683).
- **The new interface now hides the smart shelves you turned off.** If you
  unticked some entries under "Magic Shelves Visibility" in your account
  settings, the new UI sidebar still listed every smart shelf — the setting only
  worked in the classic view. The sidebar now honours it, so hidden smart
  shelves stay hidden in both interfaces. Reported by @chloeroform (#667).
- **Fixed a startup crash-loop on servers that had synced annotations to
  Hardcover.** If your library had ever synced highlights to Hardcover, an
  upgrade could get stuck restarting over and over, never finishing boot. A
  one-time database migration was refusing to run because it double-counted
  sync records the app had written during normal use. The migration now checks
  the right thing and completes, so the server starts normally again — no data
  is lost and no manual steps are needed. Reported by @PulsarFTW (#684).
- **The "Currently reading" badge now shows on the new-UI book page.** A book
  you're partway through on KOReader/Kobo showed the "Currently reading" marker
  on the classic book page but nothing on the new UI. The new-UI book page now
  displays the same marker — with the synced percentage when it's known — while
  unread and finished books still don't show it. Reported by @iroQuai (#634).
- **Fetch Metadata no longer shows the same cover for every volume of a
  series.** Searching for one volume of a series could return results where
  Vol.1, Vol.2, and Vol.3 all carried an identical cover — and applying
  metadata then saved that wrong cover onto the book. The cover-upgrade step
  now refuses to swap in artwork whose volume number disagrees with the
  book's title, and Kobo search results keep their ISBN so the exact-edition
  cover sources can be used in the first place. Reported by @boegill (#638).
- **Your shelves are listed under the SHELVES heading in the sidebar again.** In
  the new UI the sidebar showed a SHELVES heading with Tasks and About directly
  beneath it, while your actual shelves were pushed to the very bottom of the
  menu, off the end of the drawer. Shelves now appear right under the SHELVES
  heading, with Tasks and About moved to the bottom where they belong.
- **The "Contribute here!" link on the translation banner works again.** When
  your language is only partly translated, the banner offering to help now points
  at the wiki page that exists instead of a renamed one that returned a "page not
  found".

## [v4.1.5] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **"Currently Reading" now shows the right books for libraries that use a
  Calibre "Read" column.** If your admin settings link read status to a
  custom Calibre column, the Currently Reading smart shelf listed every book
  you'd marked read and never the book you were actually partway through —
  and the "reading now" badge on a book's page never appeared, even with
  KOReader progress synced. In-progress state (which comes from KOReader and
  Kobo sync) is now read from the sync tracker regardless of the configured
  column, and finished books stay out of the shelf. "Yet to Read" also now
  counts books you've never touched, instead of only books explicitly marked
  unread. Reported by @alva-seal, seconded by @iroQuai.
- **KOReader sync now works when your reader matches books by filename.**
  KOReader's sync plugin (and apps like Crossink) can identify a book by a
  hash of its filename instead of its file contents. The server only ever
  knew the content hash, so filename-mode devices always got "no book found"
  and progress never linked up. The server now registers a filename digest
  for every book — on download and, for your existing library, automatically
  at startup. This also gives devices holding older copies of a book (from
  before an update, or side-loaded) a way back into sync without re-sending
  every file: switch the KOReader sync plugin's document-matching method to
  "filename". Reported by @natabat, seconded by @Metamatam; also relevant to
  reports from @uschi1 and @Glalith121.
- **A single problem PDF can no longer hang the whole server on download.**
  Downloading certain PDFs (UI or OPDS) triggered a metadata-embedding step
  that could hang inside Calibre's PDF writer, pinning a CPU core, eating
  memory, and leaving the request stuck until a 504. The embed step is now
  bounded (90 seconds by default, tunable with `CWA_EMBED_TIMEOUT`), the hung
  Calibre process tree is cleaned up, and the download falls back to serving
  the original file from your library — you get your book instead of a dead
  server. Send-to-eReader and Kepub conversion degrade the same way instead
  of failing. Reported by @darkmatterpelican.
- **The library's view-settings (gear) menu no longer opens offscreen on
  phones.** On narrow screens the toolbar wraps, and when the gear ended up on
  the left side its menu opened toward the left and slid off the edge of the
  screen. The menu now drops below the toolbar and stays fully visible at any
  width. Reported by @iroQuai.

## [v4.1.4] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Quick-edit shortcuts are back in the new UI.** Two things the old interface
  had returned: hovering a book in your library or search results now shows a
  small pencil that drops you straight into that book's edit page — no need to
  open the book first. And on a book's page you can now add or remove individual
  tags right there (each tag has an × to remove it, plus an "Add tag" box) rather
  than opening the full editor and hand-editing a long comma-separated list. Both
  only appear if you have edit permission. Larger batch-editing improvements are
  still on the way. Reported by @magdalar.
- **The new UI's sidebar now respects which sections you've turned off.** Just
  like the classic UI, if an admin (or a per-user setting) has hidden sections
  such as Hot, Top Rated, Discover, Categories, Series, Authors, Publishers,
  Languages, Ratings, Formats, Archived, Favorites, Table view, or Duplicates,
  those entries no longer appear in the new-UI sidebar — it follows your
  configured Visibility settings instead of always showing everything. Nothing
  changes if you never hid anything. Reordering sidebar entries is still on the
  list for a later update. Requested by @Glennza1962.

### Fixed
- **The new UI can now sort a series by its reading order, and shows each book's
  position.** Opening a series in the new UI listed its books newest-first with
  no way to order them 1, 2, 3, and the series position never appeared on the
  covers unless you'd baked it into the titles. A series now opens in ascending
  series order by default, the sort menu gains "Series order" (and its reverse)
  while you're inside a series, and every cover shows its number. Reported by
  @magdalar.
- **Admin config links now work behind a reverse proxy on a sub-path.** In the
  new UI, the "More server configuration" cards on the Admin page (Basic
  configuration, Database & library path, Scheduled tasks, Logs, and the rest)
  pointed at the domain root instead of inside your mount, so on a setup served
  at something like `https://host/cwa/` they broke out of the app and landed on
  a 404. They now stay inside the sub-path like the rest of the interface.
  Installs mounted at the domain root are unaffected. Reported by @chloeroform.
- **Opening a "More server configuration" page no longer throws you out of the
  new UI.** Those cards on the Admin page link to the deep, classic
  configuration screens (database path, scheduled tasks, logs, and the like).
  Clicking one used to replace the whole new interface with the old page, so it
  felt like the app had reverted to the old UI. They now open in a new browser
  tab, so the new UI stays exactly where it was and you can close the tab to
  come back. The full native rebuild of those config screens is still on the
  roadmap. Reported by @Glennza1962.
- **The new UI now shows your site's name.** If you set a custom title under
  Admin → Basic Configuration, the new UI ignored it — the top bar, the login
  screen, and the browser tab always said "Calibre-Web NextGen". All three now
  follow your configured title; installs that never changed the title look
  exactly the same as before. Reported by @Glennza1962, confirmed by @iroQuai.
- **French (and 16 other languages) no longer offer "mark as unread" on a book
  you haven't read.** The new UI's read toggle said "Marquer comme non lu"
  (mark as unread) on unread books because the translation for "Mark as read"
  carried the opposite meaning — the same copy-paste slip existed in Arabic,
  Czech, Greek, Spanish, Finnish, Galician, Indonesian, Portuguese, Slovak,
  Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, and both Chinese
  variants. All 17 are fixed. The classic detail page's big read button also
  said "Lu" (has been read) in French where it meant "open the reader" — it
  now says "Lire", and the status badge keeps "Lu" where that's correct.
  Reported by @hayvan96.
- **You can log out again on mobile in the classic view.** With the caliBlur
  theme on a phone, tapping your username in the menu did nothing — an
  invisible upload control was swallowing the tap, so the account submenu
  with Logout never opened, and the drawer's profile area rendered squashed
  with overlapping text. The profile block now sits in its own space again
  and tapping your name reliably opens the menu. Reported by @iroQuai.
- **Switching shelves no longer mixes both shelves' books.** In the new UI,
  going from one shelf straight to another kept the first shelf's books on
  screen and drew the next shelf's books after them — and removing one of the
  leftover books actually removed it from the shelf you were now on. Each
  shelf (and smart shelf) now shows only its own books, and the page counter
  resets when you switch. Reported by @mstewart14.
- **Table view covers are no longer squished.** In the new UI's Table view,
  cover thumbnails rendered as narrow 32px slivers that cropped the sides off
  the artwork. They now display at a proper book-cover shape (48×72), and on
  desktop a title made of one long unbreakable string (common for auto-ingested
  filenames) wraps inside its cell instead of forcing the whole table to scroll
  sideways. Reported by @blahblah57.
- **The library now keeps your scroll position when you scroll the first page
  and go Back from a book.** The scroll-restore added in v4.1.1 worked once you'd
  loaded more pages, but if you only scrolled the first screen of books, opened
  one, and came back, the list jumped to the top. Reported by @KucharczykL.
- **App passwords now work with the KOReader plugin.** KOReader sync only
  accepted your main Calibre-Web password, so OAuth- or LDAP-only accounts (which
  have no local password) got "Invalid password" and a 401. KOReader progress and
  annotation sync now accept per-user app passwords, the same as OPDS already
  does. Reported by @alva-seal.

## [v4.1.3] - 2026-07-01

Corrective release: if you're on v4.1.1 or v4.1.2, update — those versions show
a stuck popup over the classic view.

### Fixed
- **The classic view no longer shows a feedback popup you can't close.** In
  v4.1.1 and v4.1.2, the optional "what made you switch back?" prompt appeared
  on every classic page — not just after switching from the new UI — and none of
  its buttons could dismiss it (on phones it didn't even fit the screen). It now
  stays hidden unless you've just switched back from the new interface, every
  button closes it, and it fits and scrolls on small screens. Reported by
  @iroQuai (#576).

## [v4.1.2] - 2026-07-01

This release carries exactly the same fixes as v4.1.1, re-published under a new
version number so the in-app "update available" prompt reaches everyone. If you
updated to v4.1.1 in the short window right after it first went out, you may have
landed on an earlier build of it; moving to v4.1.2 guarantees you're on the
corrected version. Nothing else changed — the full list of what's fixed is in the
v4.1.1 notes below.

## [v4.1.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **The new-UI edit page can now edit identifiers, and you choose which fetched
  values to apply.** Editing a book in the new interface now has an Identifiers
  table — add, change or remove ISBN, ASIN/Amazon, Google, DOI and the rest — and
  when you fetch metadata from the web, each result has a "Choose fields" checklist
  so you apply just the title, cover, description, identifiers (or whatever you
  pick) instead of overwriting everything. Reported by @uschi1 (#580).
- **Switching back to the classic view now asks (optionally) what made you
  switch.** The new interface's user menu has a "Back to the classic view" item;
  when you use it, the classic page shows a short, two-step prompt — pick what
  didn't work and add a note if you like. It's completely optional and anonymous:
  no account, name, IP address, version or device info is sent or stored (it's
  sent over HTTPS and saved as just your feedback, like unmarked mail). It only
  appears right after you switch back, and won't nag you again.

### Fixed
- **The new UI's book page now shows your KOReader/Kobo reading progress.** If
  you sync progress from KOReader or a Kobo, the book page again shows "KOReader
  progress: X%" (it was only on the classic page before — the synced progress was
  never lost). Reported by @alva-seal (#587).
- **Dutch: the new UI's book buttons read correctly.** The button that opens the
  reader said "Gelezen" ("has been read") instead of a "read now" verb, and the
  already-read marker showed the English word "Read". The reader button now says
  "Nu lezen" and the marker shows "Gelezen ✓". (Under the hood the reader action
  and the read-status label are now separate strings, so this collision can't
  recur in other languages either.) Reported in #577.
- **Book identifiers are clickable links again in the new UI.** On a book's page,
  identifiers like Goodreads, StoryGraph, Hardcover, Amazon and ISBN now link out
  to the book on that site (as they did in the classic UI) instead of showing as
  plain text. Reported by @alva-seal (#582).
- **The new UI now keeps your place in the library when you go back from a book.**
  Scrolling down, opening a book, then pressing Back used to jump you to the top
  of the library (losing loaded pages) — annoying when opening several books in a
  row. It now restores your scroll position and the books you'd already loaded.
  Reported in #578.
- **The mobile menu drawer in the new UI is now solid and scrolls properly.** On
  phones, opening the navigation menu showed a see-through panel that couldn't be
  scrolled — trying to scroll it moved the page behind instead, so lower items
  (like Magic Shelves) were unreachable. The drawer now has a solid background and
  scrolls on its own. Reported in #576.
- **The new UI now shows the Calibre-Web favicon in the browser tab.** The
  redesigned interface had a blank tab icon; it now uses the same favicon as the
  classic UI (and it works behind a reverse-proxy subpath too). Reported in #574.
- **The new UI now works behind a reverse proxy with a path prefix.** If you
  serve Calibre-Web NextGen under a subpath (e.g. `https://host/cwa/` via nginx,
  Traefik or similar), the new interface showed a blank white page because its
  scripts, styles, API calls, covers and downloads were requested without the
  prefix and 404'd. Everything now honours the mount prefix automatically, so the
  new UI loads and works the same behind a subpath as at the domain root. Reported
  by @chloeroform (#571).
- **The read/unread checkmark shows again in the new UI when read status is
  linked to a Calibre column.** If you set Admin → View Configuration → "Link
  Read/Unread Status to Calibre Column" to a custom column, the new interface
  showed every book as unread (no checkmark) and the read/unread filters returned
  everything. The new UI now reads that column, so finished books get their badge
  and the Read/Unread/Discover filters work again. The built-in read status is
  unchanged. Reported by @uschi1 (#579).

## [v4.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- **The new interface is now offered to everyone — opt in when you're ready.**
  After updating, a dismissible bar invites you to try the redesigned interface;
  your classic view stays the default until you tap "Try the new UI" (or the
  "Switch to New UI" button in the top bar). Dismiss it and it stays gone until
  the next update, when it gently reminds you again. You can still turn the new
  interface off entirely by setting `CWNG_SPA=0`. (Previously the new UI was
  hidden unless an admin opted the whole instance in.)

### Added
- **A redesigned "Change cover" screen in the new UI.** Picking a new cover now
  opens a polished page instead of the old one: your current cover with a one-tap
  **lock** (so a metadata refresh can't overwrite it), a grid of candidates from
  every source we search (plus the cover embedded in the book), and tabs to paste
  a URL or upload your own. If you use a Kobo, flip on **E-reader preview** to see
  how each candidate looks padded for your device before you choose. You can reach
  it straight from a book — hover or tap its cover and choose **Change cover** —
  or from the edit page. Keyboard- and screen-reader-friendly throughout.
- **A "Discover" shelf of random picks on your library home (new UI).** The
  redesigned library now opens with a set-apart "Discover" box — a row of random
  books from your collection to stumble onto something to read. Hit the shuffle
  button for a fresh set, dismiss it with the × in its corner, and bring it back
  any time from the new gear (View settings → "Show Discover section"). Your
  choice is remembered on that device.
- **"Remember me" and a show-password toggle are back on the new sign-in screen.**
  The redesigned login page now has the "Remember me" checkbox (on by default, so
  you stay signed in) and an eye button to reveal what you typed — matching the
  classic login.
- **Magic-link sign-in now has a polished page in the new UI.** Choosing "Log in
  with a magic link" opens a redesigned screen with the QR code, a one-tap copy of
  the verification link, a live "waiting…" indicator and an expiry countdown. Scan
  or open it on a device you're already signed in on and the waiting device logs in
  automatically. (Previously this dropped you onto the old-style page.)
- **The version number on the Admin page links to its release notes.** The
  "Calibre-Web NextGen" version in the Version Information table (Admin page) is
  now a link to that release's notes on GitHub, so you can see what changed in
  the build you're running. Dev/canary builds link to the releases list instead.
  Requested by @chloeroform.
- **Email your users straight from the admin area.** A new "Email Your Users"
  page (Admin → Email Your Users) lets you write a message and send it by email
  to everyone — or just the people you pick. Handy for announcing new books or
  server updates to the people sharing your library. It uses the same mail
  server you already set up for password resets, formats with HTML (links,
  bold) with an automatic plain-text fallback, can pull in your announcement
  banner text with one click, and has a "Send test to me" button so you can
  preview before sending. Messages send in the background — check Tasks for
  delivery. Requested by @froggybottomboys.

### Fixed
- **Uploading a book with a very long filename no longer fails.** A file whose
  name ran past the filesystem limit (~255 characters) used to fail to import
  with an unhelpful "Failed to queue for processing" message. The temporary
  staging name is now trimmed to fit (the file is renamed from its metadata on
  import anyway), so the upload succeeds. Normal filenames are untouched.
  Reported by @chloeroform (#553).
- **Bulk actions and drag-to-merge now work behind a reverse proxy on a
  sub-path.** If you run NextGen under a proxy mounted at something like
  `example.com/books/`, marking books read/unread, adding a selection to a
  shelf, deleting selected books, the cover badge toggle, and dragging one
  book onto another to merge all failed with a 404 — those requests went to
  the server root instead of your sub-path. They now use the correct path in
  every setup. Nothing changes if you don't use a sub-path proxy. Reported by
  @chloeroform.
- **The "Discover (Random Books)" row now actually appears.** Turning on "Show
  Random Books in Detail View" did nothing — a leftover theme rule hid the
  random-books row for everyone, so the "No. of Random Books to Display" setting
  had no visible effect. The row now shows as a "Discover (Random Books)" strip
  above your book list, on desktop and mobile. Reported by @chloeroform.
- **Changing the "Regular Expression for Title Sorting" now re-sorts your whole
  library right away.** After editing that setting (Admin → UI Configuration),
  the book order didn't change until you edited each book one by one — the new
  rule only applied to books you touched afterwards. Saving the setting now
  recomputes the sort order for every book immediately, the same way Calibre
  desktop does. Reported by @chloeroform.

## [v4.0.172] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- **Books you're partway through now show a "Currently reading" badge.** If you
  read on KOReader (or a Kobo) and your progress syncs back, the book used to
  look exactly like one you'd never opened — the web only marked books as read
  once you finished them. Now an in-progress book gets an amber "Currently
  reading" marker on its detail page and a badge on its cover in the grid,
  shelves, search and author pages, so synced reading progress is actually
  visible. Reported by @barukh27.

### Fixed
- **Sorting the Books List by Title no longer breaks the table.** In the "Books
  List" table view, clicking the Title, Title Sort, or Series ID column header
  produced an empty table and flooded the log with `no such column: title`
  errors — only Author sorting worked. The table now sorts correctly by every
  column. Reported by @Mr-Me-torn.

## [v4.0.171] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Choose what permissions new Generic OAuth users get.** Instead of every
  OAuth sign-up inheriting the one global default role, admins can now set a
  per-provider permission set (downloads, viewer, uploads, edit, delete, change
  password, edit public shelves) for accounts auto-created via Generic OAuth.
  Leaving it unconfigured keeps the existing global default, so upgrading
  changes nothing until you opt in. Existing users are untouched. Thanks to
  @lduesing.
- **Restrict Generic OAuth/OIDC login to specific identity-provider groups.**
  Admins can now require that a user belong to one of an allowed list of OAuth
  groups before an account is created or logged in, and can name the token claim
  that carries the group list (handy for Keycloak/Authentik, which often use a
  custom claim rather than `groups`). Membership is enforced before any account
  is provisioned, and turning the requirement on with an empty allow-list denies
  everyone rather than admitting all directory users. Thanks to @lduesing.

### Fixed
- **"Send to eReader" now shows the real reason it failed.** When your mail
  server rejected the recipient address, the send used to die with a confusing
  `TypeError` and hid the actual rejection. It now reports the address and the
  server's reason (e.g. `kid@home.net: 550 User unknown`) so you can fix it.
  Reported by @kurtlieber.
- **Beta (`:dev`) builds no longer nag about a "false" update.** If you run the
  beta image, the "update available" banner kept pointing at the latest *stable*
  release even though a beta build is actually ahead of it. Beta/unversioned
  builds are now recognised and don't show the banner.
- **Stacked notices no longer pile up into an unreadable blur.** When more than
  one pop-up notice showed at once — e.g. the duplicate-scan setup notice plus
  the update banner — they all floated to the same spot and rendered on top of
  each other. They now stack neatly in a column.

## [v4.0.170] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Update from a button instead of hunting for the right Docker command.** When
  a new version is available, the update banner and the Admin page now show an
  **Update now** button that gives you the exact one-line command for your setup
  — Docker Compose, `docker run`, Unraid, or Portainer/Synology — with one-click
  copy. A new **Automatic updates** section under Admin → NextGen Settings walks
  you through turning on truly hands-off updates with Watchtower, so new versions
  install themselves. (Admin only.) The README gains a matching "Updating" guide,
  including how to run NextGen under Podman.

### Fixed
- **The epub reader's Settings panel no longer sits flush against its edges.**
  After the recent settings redesign, the option labels were pressed against the
  left edge and the slider readouts ("150%", "0px") were clipped at the right.
  The panel now insets its content again, and the "Settings" title keeps its
  full-width bar across the top. Reported by @sambong.
- **The Duplicate Books page works again behind a reverse proxy on a sub-path.**
  Behind a proxy mounted on a sub-path, the cover placeholder kept requesting
  `generic_cover.svg` in an endless loop, and dismissing or resolving a duplicate
  group failed with "Failed to update duplicate group." Both came from page URLs
  that dropped the proxy's sub-path prefix; they now carry it. Reported by
  @chloeroform.

## [v4.0.169] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Simplified Chinese (`zh_Hans`): more of the interface now appears in Chinese —
  279 menu, button and message strings that previously fell back to English are
  translated. Thanks to @GSAlex.
- Spanish (`es`): 76 strings that were showing in English — or, in a few cases,
  the wrong Spanish phrase — now read correctly. This covers the duplicate-book
  tools, OAuth sign-in messages and several admin labels. Thanks to @HaruIjima-kun.

### Fixed
- **Kobo no longer re-downloads your whole magic shelf on every sync.** If you
  synced magic (smart) shelves to a Kobo, books kept dropping back to
  "Download"/"Unread" and losing your place — every sync unless you synced twice
  back-to-back. The shelf's membership cache was being re-stamped with a new
  timestamp every 30 minutes even when nothing changed, which made the sync
  re-send the entire shelf. It now only re-sends when the shelf's contents
  actually change. Reported by @Glennza1962 and @bigbold1023.
- **Right-click on an image in the epub reader now offers "Save image as"
  again.** The reader was swallowing the right-click (and Android long-press)
  menu on everything so the in-app highlight popup could be the way you select
  text — but that also blocked the browser's own menu on illustrations, so you
  couldn't save a picture. Images now get their native menu back (including the
  iOS long-press "Save Image"), while right-clicking text still opens the
  highlight popup. Reported by @sambong.
- **The epub reader's Settings panel no longer gets cut off on short browser
  windows.** On a window shorter than the panel — common on a NAS admin tab — the
  Theme row at the top and the Font, Spread and Reflow options at the bottom were
  clipped off-screen with no way to scroll to them. The panel now caps its height
  and scrolls internally at every window size, so every setting stays reachable.
  Reported by @sambong.

## [v4.0.168] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **Archiving a book now updates the shelf count in the sidebar.** The badge
  next to a shelf name counted archived books even though opening the shelf
  already hid them, so the number stayed too high. It now matches what you see
  inside the shelf. Reported by @jasonxbergman.

## [v4.0.167] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- You can now **support Calibre-Web NextGen's development** directly — the
  project has its own [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/calibrewebnextgen), linked from the
  README and the GitHub "Sponsor" button. (The upstream project it builds on is
  still credited and linked too.)

### Fixed
- **Hardcover metadata search no longer fails when one of your saved API tokens
  is stale.** If you have both a per-account token and a global one, search used
  the per-account token and gave up if it was expired — even when the global
  token was valid. It now tries each configured token until one is accepted, and
  trims a stray `Bearer ` prefix or whitespace from a pasted token. Thanks to
  @WasabiBurns for diagnosing the precedence.
- On a Kobo that syncs **by shelves**, a book you're currently reading no longer
  gets **removed from the device and forced to re-download** because of a
  momentary database hiccup while the server works out which books belong on
  your sync shelves. If it can't read that list reliably, the sync now leaves
  your books in place and reconciles on the next sync, instead of treating the
  failure as "this shelf is empty." Reported by @Glennza1962 and @bigbold1023.

## [v4.0.166] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- The **KOReader sync plugin can now be kept up to date with the Updates
  Manager plugin** (updatesmanager.koplugin) instead of hand-copying files onto
  your device. The plugin now reports its version where Updates Manager looks
  for it, and every release ships a ready-to-install `cwasync.koplugin.zip` on
  the GitHub release page — extract it into KOReader's `plugins` folder, or
  point Updates Manager at this repository to install updates from the KOReader
  menu. Requested by @filiporlo.
- **Tap the left or right side of the page to turn pages in the web reader.**
  The page is split down the middle — tap (or click) the right half to go
  forward, the left half to go back. Swiping left/right still works. Two
  annoyances are fixed along the way: a stray finger-wobble no longer flips the
  page, and selecting text to highlight no longer turns the page out from under
  you.
- **Your reader display settings now follow you across devices.** Theme, font,
  font size, page layout and the new text-margin setting are saved to your
  account, so a book you open on your phone looks the way you set it on your
  laptop — previously these lived only in one browser and didn't travel.
- **Adjustable text margins in the reader.** A new slider in the reader's
  Settings trims the side whitespace to fit more text per line, or widens it —
  whatever's comfortable to read.
- You can now **star your favorite books**. Tap the star on a book's page — or
  the star on its cover anywhere in the grid — to favorite it; favorited books
  show a gold star on the cover. Use the new **Favorites** entry in the sidebar
  to see just your starred books. Favorites are private to your own account.
- The **Published Date** field now accepts just a **year**. When you edit a
  book you can type `2020` (or `2020-05`) instead of clicking through the date
  picker for the full day — the missing month and day default to January 1st.
  Handy for the many books that only carry a publication year. Thanks to
  @huperaisan for the suggestion.

### Changed
- On the **main books list**, your **starred books now float to the top**, so
  your favorites are the first thing you see in the full library (the Favorites
  sidebar entry still shows them on their own). Within the starred group your
  chosen sort order still applies. Only the main list is affected — author,
  series, category and search views keep their usual order.
- **Duplicate detection catches more real duplicates.** Books that differ only
  by accents (Café vs Cafe) or punctuation (The Book! vs The Book) are now
  recognized as the same. It stays deliberately careful not to merge genuinely
  different books — "Dune" vs "Dune: Messiah" and "Volume 1" vs "Volume 2" stay
  separate — so nothing distinct gets wrongly flagged for removal.
- The **Magic Shelf editor** is easier to use on a phone. The rule builder and
  the Kobo-sync / OPDS / public option cards were being squeezed into a narrow
  strip with big wasted margins; they now use much more of the screen width, and
  each rule's field/operator/value controls stack full-width instead of
  clustering. A typo that mis-sized the rule's field dropdown is fixed too
  (helps desktop).
- In the **web reader**, long-pressing or right-clicking text no longer pops up
  the browser's own menu competing with the highlight popup — the in-app
  highlight menu is the one that shows. (On iOS Safari, Apple's built-in
  text-selection menu still appears alongside it; that one can't be switched off
  from a web page.)
- The **reader's Settings panel** has a cleaner layout — clearly labelled
  sections, live value readouts on the font-size and margin sliders, and bigger
  touch targets that fit comfortably on a phone.
- The **book details page** is easier to read, especially on phones. The big
  empty margins that boxed in the cover and info are gone — you get noticeably
  more width for the title, tags and description — and the page is tidier
  overall. The star rating now shows clean stars instead of a stray white box.
  On wider screens the cover and details sit side-by-side from 1024px up
  (previously only above 1400px), so desktops and landscape tablets use the
  width instead of stranding the cover alone in the middle.
- The book details page now has a clear **Read** button right under the cover —
  the full width of the cover — as the obvious way to start reading in your
  browser. The small "read" icon was removed from the row of action buttons so
  that row is less cluttered.

### Fixed
- Books that a download client adds by **hardlink** into a subfolder of the
  ingest directory are now picked up automatically. Apps like Readarr and
  Bookshelf (via qBittorrent) hardlink completed downloads into per-author
  subfolders; a hardlink fires only a "create" filesystem event, never the
  "close-write" the ingest watcher waited for, so those books were silently
  skipped until you moved them to the ingest root by hand. The watcher now also
  acts on a completed hardlink (a file that already has its full contents),
  while still leaving an in-progress download to finish writing before it is
  ingested. Reported by @stuhby.
- A book you're in the middle of reading no longer **disappears from the
  "Currently Reading" shelf** just because it has no language set. If you've
  picked a preferred language in your account, the shelf used to silently hide
  any in-progress book missing language metadata — which often hit PDFs while
  EPUBs (which usually carry a language) stayed visible, even though the book's
  own page still showed your reading progress. The progress shelves now ignore
  the language preference, so everything you're actually reading shows up. Your
  other library filters (hidden, archived, tag restrictions) are unaffected.
  Thanks to @chloeroform for the report.
- On a phone, tapping the **Search** box (or other text fields) no longer zooms
  the page in. iOS Safari zooms toward any field whose text is smaller than 16px;
  the inputs are now sized so that doesn't happen, while pinch-to-zoom still works
  normally.
- The cover editor's **Back** link now returns you to wherever you opened it from —
  the book's page when you tapped its cover, or the edit screen when you came from
  there — instead of always jumping to the edit screen. The **Edit metadata** screen
  also gained a clear **Back to book** link at the top, and on a phone its form is no
  longer pushed off-screen.
- On a phone, the **Edit Metadata** page now shows the book's details form first —
  you can edit the title, author and tags straight away instead of scrolling past
  the cover. On wider screens the cover and form still sit side-by-side. (Builds on
  the earlier off-screen-form fix; replaces a brittle fixed-offset layout.)

## [v4.0.165] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- On a desktop browser, the **Fetch Metadata** popup on the Edit Book page no
  longer runs off the bottom of the screen when a search returns a long list of
  results — the "Close" button at the bottom stays on screen. Previously the
  popup grew taller than the window and the only way to dismiss it was the small
  "X" in the corner; zooming the page out to 80% was the usual workaround.
  Reported by @sltvtr.

### Changed
- The Custom CSS and server announcement banner options moved to the **UI
  Configuration** admin page. They were previously on Basic Configuration,
  tucked inside the "Logfile Configuration" section next to the log level — an
  unintuitive spot that also disagreed with the documentation. They now sit in
  their own "Site Customization" section on the UI Configuration page. Existing
  values are preserved; nothing about how custom CSS or the banner behaves has
  changed, only where you set them. Reported by @Andrew-H2O.

## [v4.0.164] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- Editing a book whose author shares a name with another author after accents
  are stripped (for example "George Pólya" alongside "George Polya", or two
  Chinese names that romanize the same way) no longer fails with a database
  error. Previously any metadata change to such a book — even just adding a
  cover — was rejected. Reported on Calibre-Web by @annProg, @apetresc and
  @wnmurphy.
- On the caliBlur theme, the read-status quick-action button that appears when
  you hover a book cover now shows the right icon and tooltip the moment a page
  loads. In book lists like Read Books, search results and author pages, an
  already-read book used to show "Mark As Read" until you clicked it once;
  it now correctly shows "Mark As Unread" straight away. (Reported by @droM4X
  on #319)

## [v4.0.163] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- French (`fr`): the Hardcover integration labels no longer translate the service name "Hardcover" as "livres reliés" (hardback books). "Run Hardcover Auto-Fetch", "Hardcover Token Required" and "Enable Hardcover Auto-Fetch" now keep the Hardcover name so the buttons match the feature. Thanks to @Korri.
- Spanish (`es`): the "Invalid request" error now reads "Petición inválida" instead of the incorrect "Rol inválido" (Invalid role), and punctuation is tidied across 36 shared interface strings to match the source text. Thanks to @pablo-alcaniz.
- German (`de`): fixed 11 interface strings that showed the wrong text — the cover-size limit read "5-120 Minuten" (minutes) instead of "1–200 MB", "Failed to update shelves" showed the tags message, and "KOReader Sync is disabled" showed the default-login message. OIDC, logfile, email and Magic Shelves labels are corrected too. Thanks to @futurelook.

## [v4.0.162] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- You can now write your own message for the emails the server sends with a
  book. Edit Email Server Settings has a new "Email Message Body" box; whatever
  you type there replaces the default "This Email has been sent via
  Calibre-Web NextGen." on books sent to an eReader and on test emails. Write
  it in any language, add a link to your library, keep it short — leave the box
  blank to keep the original wording. (Requested by @iroQuai in #428)
- Admins can now style their instance with their own CSS. A new Custom CSS
  box under Admin → Edit UI Configuration injects your rules into every page
  as the last stylesheet, so they override the built-in themes — recolor the
  navbar, tweak spacing, adjust for your screen, all without editing source,
  and it survives upgrades because it lives in the database. The box is
  admin-only and can't accidentally break the page layout. (Issue #323 by
  @olskar)
- Magic Shelves can now filter on your Calibre custom columns. The rule
  builder lists every queryable custom column — text, numbers, yes/no,
  dates, ratings, and fixed-choice columns (which get a proper dropdown of
  their allowed values) — so shelves like "Mood is cozy" or "Page Count
  over 400" just work, including the "is empty / is not empty" operators.
  (PR #387 by @8bitgentleman)
- You can now open the same library in Calibre desktop while the server is
  running. Set `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true` plus the new
  `DESKTOP_COMPAT_MODE=true` and the server releases its database lock
  between web requests, so Calibre desktop opens the library instead of
  crashing or hanging; edits you make there show up in the web UI on the
  next page load. Occasional desktop use is the intent — heavy simultaneous
  use of both slows the web UI rather than corrupting anything. See the
  README's "Calibre desktop coexistence" section for trade-offs.
  (PR #386 by @8bitgentleman)

### Changed
- Loading spinners are crisp at any size and follow your theme's color. The
  old animated GIFs (admin Restart/Status dialogs, settings save flashes, the
  book reader, and the PDF viewer) rendered pixelated and ignored your theme;
  they're replaced by a smooth CSS ring that matches the theme's primary
  color, centers correctly everywhere, and slows down rather than freezing
  when your system asks for reduced motion. (PR #384 by @jbelascoain)

### Fixed
- The hover button for marking a book read/unread in the library grid now
  uses the same checkbox icons as the book page, instead of an eye symbol
  that looked like a hide/show control. The icon also tells you what the
  click will do — checkbox for "mark as read", unchecked box for "mark as
  unread" — and updates after each click. (#319 follow-up, reported by
  @droM4X)
- Turning on DEBUG logging no longer fills docker logs with repeating Magic
  Shelf messages. The "Found N total magic shelves", per-shelf "Hiding...",
  and "Filtered to N visible" lines fired on every request — an open browser
  tab meant the same block every ~3 seconds. They're now a single line that
  only appears when your shelf setup actually changes, with the hidden
  shelves named in it. (Fix by @KucharczykL in #443; reported by @SpookyUSAF
  in #445 and on CWA as #1060)
- Hardcover progress sync now survives Hardcover deleting or merging a book.
  If your book's saved Hardcover ID no longer exists ("We weren't able to
  find that book. Was it deleted?" in the logs), the sync looks up the
  book's current ID from its edition or slug and retries instead of
  giving up. When nothing can be looked up, the log now tells you the fix
  (refresh the book's metadata) instead of only the raw API error.
  (Follow-up to #433, reported by @SpookyUSAF)
- Calibre plugin and configuration loading is now reliable when you opt in
  with `CWA_CALIBRE_USER_PLUGINS=true`. The image used to set a misspelled
  environment variable (`CALIBRE_CONFIG_DIR`) that Calibre simply ignores, so
  Calibre invocations could fall back to a nonexistent home directory and
  miss plugins installed under `/config/.config/calibre/plugins`. The opt-in
  now sets Calibre's documented `CALIBRE_CONFIG_DIRECTORY` on every Calibre
  subprocess it covers (ingest, conversion, cover enforcement, metadata
  embed). Plugin loading stays off unless you opt in. (Diagnosed by
  @jasonobrien in #434)
- **LubimyCzytac.pl metadata search returned "no results" for every book.**
  The Polish catalog redesigned its site, so the provider's search and book-page
  parsing no longer matched anything — searches came back empty even though the
  site was reachable. Search now finds books again, and publisher, description,
  language, rating and publication date populate correctly on the metadata
  screen. Reported by @sltvtr (#431).
- Dropping an Adobe `.acsm` file into the ingest folder now explains what
  actually went wrong. An `.acsm` is a download ticket, not a book, so
  conversion fails — but the log only showed Calibre's cryptic "No plugin to
  handle input format: acsm" (followed by a stray "None"). The ingest log now
  spells out the two ways forward: install the ACSM Input plugin via
  `CWA_CALIBRE_USER_PLUGINS`, or fulfill the ticket in Adobe Digital Editions
  or Calibre desktop and ingest the downloaded book. Failure mode surfaced by
  @jbelascoain in #388 (#448).

## [v4.0.161] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- Hardcover progress sync no longer dies on books without a chosen edition.
  Reading on a KOReader/Kobo device synced progress to the library fine, but
  the push to Hardcover failed every time with `'NoneType' object has no
  attribute 'get'` — typically when the book's entry on Hardcover has no
  edition picked, or when Hardcover rejects a status change. The sync now
  handles those responses, logs Hardcover-side errors with a full traceback,
  and tells you when a book needs an edition selected on Hardcover for
  page-based progress. (#433, reported by @SpookyUSAF)
- Search now opens on phones. Tapping the search icon in the top bar did
  nothing on mobile (most visibly in Safari on iOS) — the icon was covered by
  the header bar, so the tap never reached the search box, and the box never
  appeared. Tapping the icon now opens the search field as expected. Desktop is
  unchanged. (#425, reported by @getthething)
- On phones, the book detail page no longer shows an oversized, off-center
  cover. The cover used to render wider than its column and sit left of center
  (on the caliBlur theme), pushing the description far down the page. It now
  caps to its column and centers, and the title/spacing on narrow screens are
  tightened so the description sits closer to the top. (#288, reported with a
  screenshot by @iroQuai)

## [v4.0.160] - 2026-06-10

### Security
- Closed a cross-site scripting hole in the comic (CBR/CBZ) reader. The reader
  ran your saved page bookmark through JavaScript's `eval()`, so a bookmark
  value that contained code — which any logged-in account could store for a
  comic — would execute when the reader page opened. Bookmarks are now read
  strictly as a page number.

### Fixed
- The metadata search dialog now lists providers in the order you set under
  Settings, instead of alphabetically. Whatever provider order you configure
  for automatic metadata fetching is now also the order the search popup shows
  and ranks results in, so your preferred source appears first.
- Adding several books at once to a Kobo-synced shelf now syncs them to
  Hardcover, just like adding one book does. Before, only single adds reached
  Hardcover — "add all" from search results, multi-select adds, and
  add-series-to-shelf silently skipped it. The sync now runs as a background
  task (visible under Tasks, cancellable), so adding a long series doesn't
  hold the page open on an external service — and single adds respond faster
  for the same reason.
- The experimental "SQL" duplicate-scan mode no longer produces different (and
  sometimes wrong) results than the default mode. It grouped co-authored books
  into multiple duplicate groups at once and skipped a title normalization the
  default scan applies, so the same library showed different duplicates
  depending on an admin toggle. That mode now uses the same single grouping
  engine as everything else, keeping SQL only as the fast candidate prefilter.
- Books you've hidden no longer show up in your duplicate scan. The Duplicates
  page respected your language, tag, and archive filters but not your hidden
  list, so hidden books reappeared there and could even be swept into
  duplicate auto-resolution.
- Duplicate detection now catches copies whose titles differ only in unicode
  form or spacing. A "Café" imported from a Mac (decomposed accents) and a
  "Café" typed by hand, or "The  Book" with a double space, counted as
  different books and never showed up as duplicates. All duplicate matching
  now normalizes accents and whitespace first; the duplicate index rebuilds
  itself on first scan after the update, and your existing dismissals carry
  over automatically.
- Dismissed duplicate groups stay dismissed. Adding another copy of a book or
  editing its title changed the group's internal label, so groups you had
  dismissed popped back onto the Duplicates page (and could re-enter
  auto-resolve). Dismissals are now tied to the group's stable identity and
  survive new ingests and metadata edits; existing dismissals are upgraded
  automatically the first time they match. Two different groups that happened
  to share a display title also no longer share one dismissal.
- Merging duplicate books can no longer overwrite one of the kept book's
  files. If a file with the merge target's name was already on disk (from an
  earlier partial failure or a manual edit), the merge silently copied over
  it; it now refuses that group with a clear error and leaves every file
  untouched. A merge that fails partway also cleans up after itself instead
  of leaving stray copied files or phantom format entries behind.
- Finishing a book in KOReader now marks it read on the website when you use a
  custom "read" column. If your admin set a Calibre custom column as the read
  marker (a stock option under Feature Configuration), KOReader completions
  only wrote the built-in read list, so the book page checkmark stayed empty.
  The sync now also sets the custom column — and only ever sets it: re-opening
  a finished book never silently un-reads it.
- Automatic metadata fetch now actually downloads covers. The "update cover"
  option existed but did nothing — books imported with auto-fetch on never got
  their cover updated. Covers now download through the same safe path as the
  manual editor (size limits, image checks, server-side request protections),
  respect the per-book cover lock, and in "smart application" mode only fill in
  a missing cover, never replace one you have. (#404, confirmed by @beanscg)
- Downloading a cover by URL (manual editor and auto-fetch alike) no longer
  destroys the existing cover when the server misbehaves: a redirect stub or an
  error page served with an image content-type used to get saved as the cover
  file. The download now follows redirects properly (cover CDNs like Open
  Library's redirect every image) and verifies the bytes are really an image
  before anything is overwritten.
- Shelf reorder: the giant white sort icon (a down arrow with lines) that sat on
  top of the first covers on wide screens is gone. It was a leftover decoration
  from the old list-style reorder page — the theme drew it in what used to be
  empty space, and the new cover grid now fills that space. The wider your
  browser window, the bigger the icon got. (#320, reported with screenshots by
  @SpookyUSAF — the covers themselves were already the right size; this was the
  last piece.)
- Resolving duplicate books no longer loses your highlights, notes, reading
  progress, or shelf placement. When duplicates were merged or resolved, only
  the book files moved to the kept copy — anything you'd done on the removed
  copy (annotations, read status, Kobo reading position, shelf membership)
  silently disappeared. All of it now follows the kept book, whichever
  resolve strategy you use. Deleting a book and deleting a user also clean up
  everything that belongs to them now (deleted accounts previously left their
  annotations and annotation-backup files behind).
- Deleting a book no longer risks leaving a broken "ghost" entry if something
  fails partway through. Previously the book's files were removed before the
  library database was updated, so an error in between could leave an entry that
  still shows in your library but won't open. The database is now updated first
  and the files removed last, so a failure leaves the book fully intact. (Mirrors
  the same data-safety fix already made for duplicate resolution.)
- Shelf reorder covers: the stylesheet that keeps the covers at the normal
  thumbnail size now loads from the page head, alongside every other stylesheet,
  instead of from the page body. A body-loaded stylesheet link can be dropped by
  some reverse proxies, which left the covers oversized on an otherwise-correct
  page — the case @SpookyUSAF kept hitting on caliBlur even after v4.0.158/159.
  (#320 follow-up, reported by @SpookyUSAF)
- Automatic metadata fetch (the admin "auto metadata fetch" option, off by
  default) no longer overwrites a book's correct author, ISBN, series,
  publication date or rating with a wrong match's. Previously, with auto-fetch
  on, importing a book could silently replace good metadata with a random
  foreign edition's — and the "smart application" mode that's meant to only fill
  gaps didn't actually protect those fields. Now it prefers the edition whose
  ISBN matches your book, and smart mode never overwrites a value you already
  have (it only fills what's missing). Open Library is also now part of the
  default provider order.

## [v4.0.159] – 2026-06-09

### Added
- You can now add books to a shelf right from the shelf page. A new **Add Books**
  button opens a searchable picker — type to find books in your library, tick the
  ones you want, and add them all at once. Books already on the shelf show as
  "Already on this shelf" so you can't add duplicates, and it works on phone and
  desktop. Especially handy for filling a brand-new empty shelf.

### Fixed
- Resolving duplicate books no longer risks leaving a book in a broken,
  half-deleted state if something fails partway through. Previously the files
  were removed before the library database was updated, so an error in between
  could leave a "ghost" book that still showed in your library but wouldn't open.
  The database is now updated first and the files removed last, so a failure
  leaves the book fully intact and the duplicate is simply re-resolved next time.
- Resolving duplicate books is now safe even if a duplicate scan happens to run
  at the same moment. Before, the two could collide — deleting the same book
  twice, leaving a duplicate only half-removed, or throwing a brief error that
  left the library inconsistent. Now only one resolution runs at a time and the
  other steps aside, so your books stay intact.
- Duplicate detection no longer treats books that are *missing* a title or
  author as duplicates of each other. Two unrelated books that both happen to
  have no title (or no author) used to collapse together as a "duplicate" — and
  could then be offered up for deletion. They're now kept separate; only books
  with real matching metadata are grouped.
- Resolving duplicate books is more reliable: the resolver no longer closes a
  shared database connection mid-operation, which could cause errors or a
  half-finished cleanup when the library was being used at the same time.
- The shelf reorder screen's cover-size fix now reaches more setups: the covers
  were still showing oversized for some users on v4.0.158 (e.g. behind certain
  reverse proxies). The styling moved out of the page into a regular stylesheet
  and now sizes covers on its own, so they stay at the normal thumbnail size
  regardless of theme or proxy. (#320 follow-up, reported by @SpookyUSAF)
- On phones, the menu (hamburger) button is now on the **left**, the same side
  the navigation drawer slides out from — so the button and the menu it opens
  line up. Tapping it opens the menu; tapping outside still closes it.
- On phones, the select and settings buttons above a book list now sit on the
  right (matching the desktop layout), so tapping the gear opens its menu on
  screen instead of off the left edge where it was getting cut off.
- Pages no longer occasionally fall back to the old, deprecated light theme —
  including error pages. That fallback could happen when a request hit a snag
  while loading, and it was the underlying cause of display glitches like the
  oversized shelf-reorder covers (#320). The dark theme is now enforced even on
  error pages and requests that are interrupted before they finish loading.

## [v4.0.158] – 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- The shelf reorder screen now shows covers at the normal thumbnail size
  instead of blown-up "large icon" size, and the Back button lines up under
  the covers with proper spacing above it. (#320 follow-up, reported by
  @droM4X and @SpookyUSAF)

## [v4.0.157] – 2026-06-07

### Added
- You can now add a whole series to a shelf in one click: series pages have an
  "Add Series to Shelf" button that adds every book in series order, skipping
  ones already on the shelf. (#334, requested by @Glennza1962)
- The book detail and edit pages now show the filename a book was imported
  with ("Imported as: …"). Ingest renames files to match their metadata —
  including wrong auto-matches — so the original name is the one stable
  reference for recognizing misidentified books while you fix their tags.
  Captured automatically for new imports from this version on. (#346,
  requested by @BakaPhoenix and @magdalar)

### Changed
- Rearranging a shelf now happens in the same cover grid as the regular shelf
  view — drag a cover where it belongs, on desktop or phone (long-press to
  lift), or move it with the keyboard arrows. The order saves by itself on
  every change; the old cramped list and its Save button are gone. A shelf
  that changed in another tab no longer breaks saving. (#320, requested by
  @SpookyUSAF with design input from @droM4X)
- Series pages now list books in series order by default (1, 2, 3…) instead of
  newest-first — matching what the OPDS feed always did. Choosing a different
  sort still sticks for next time.
- On phones, the menu button now looks like one: a standard hamburger icon
  replaces the round profile-head glyph, which nobody recognized as the way
  to open the sidebar. Same spot (top right), same tap target; your profile
  options are inside the menu it opens, where they always were.

### Fixed
- On phones, opening the sidebar no longer dead-ends the page: tapping
  anywhere outside the menu now closes it (it used to do nothing, and the
  menu button itself became untappable behind the overlay — the page was
  stuck until a reload).
- Fixed a rare freeze where the whole app could lock up — pages never loading
  until the container was restarted — when a background task (thumbnail
  generation, metadata backup, duplicate scan…) hit the database at the same
  moment as a page load. Database access is now coordinated so the standoff
  can't happen.
- Kobo sync no longer fails behind reverse proxies with default buffer sizes
  (Synology DSM, stock nginx). The sync token header could exceed nginx's 4K
  default when Kobo store proxying was on; it's now compressed to roughly
  half the size, with older tokens still accepted — no device reconfiguration
  needed. If you added `proxy_buffer_size` overrides for this, they can stay
  (harmless) or go. (#331, reported by @Gusdezup)
- "Reload Metadata" now also reloads authors, tags, and series (with series
  number) from the book file — previously only title, description, publisher,
  publish date, and languages came through. Author changes also rename the
  book's folder and file to match, the same way editing in the web UI does.
  A file that's missing its author or tags fields leaves your existing data
  alone instead of wiping it. (#218, reported by @yodatak)
- Adding a single book to a Kobo-synced shelf without JavaScript now syncs it
  to Hardcover the same way the normal button does.
- Bulk shelf adds no longer claim books were added when a database error
  actually rolled everything back.

## [v4.0.156] – 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **Magic Shelves marked for Kobo sync now actually reach your Kobo** — books
  deliver and the shelf appears as a collection on the device. Previously a
  global setting (off by default) silently swallowed the per-shelf "Enable Kobo
  sync" checkbox; if you'd ever ticked that checkbox, the upgrade enables the
  global setting for you automatically. The checkbox now also tells you when the
  global setting is off instead of silently doing nothing. (#359, reported with
  excellent diagnostics by @recruiterguy)

### Security
- `POST /duplicates/invalidate-cache` now requires authentication — previously
  it accepted unauthenticated requests on internet-facing deployments (limited
  impact: it could only force a duplicate-scan refresh). (#370, found and fixed
  by @8bitgentleman)

### Added
- A `:dev` docker channel: `ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:dev` gets
  every merge as it lands — it's what we run at home. Versioned releases now
  batch to at most one per day, so release notifications get quieter.

## [v4.0.155] – 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Kobo sync: after a Magic Shelf cache rebuild, the per-shelf delivery cursor
  could silently revert to a stale value, leaving newly-added low-numbered books
  undelivered until the next shelf change. (#368 follow-up)

## [v4.0.154] – 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Kobo sync: adding a book to a Magic Shelf between syncs now reliably delivers
  it — the sync cursor detects the cache rebuild and re-walks the shelf. (#367
  follow-up)

## [v4.0.153] – 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Kobo sync: Magic Shelves with more than 100 books no longer re-send the same
  first 100 books forever — delivery now pages through the whole shelf. (#366
  follow-up)

## [v4.0.152] – 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Kobo sync: when more than 100 books were pending at once alongside a Magic
  Shelf refresh, some regular books could be skipped permanently. Nothing is
  dropped anymore. (#361 follow-up)

## [v4.0.151] – 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Kobo sync: Magic Shelf delivery and cache refresh now work in
  sync-entire-library mode, not just "selected shelves only" mode. (#359)

## [v4.0.150] – 2026-06-05

### Changed
- Read/unread toggle on the book detail page now shows the action you're about
  to take (checkmark = "mark as read") instead of the current state, and the
  read badge uses a consistent checkmark icon everywhere. (#319)

## [v4.0.149] – 2026-06-05

### Added
- "Reload Metadata" button on the book detail page — re-reads title, author,
  and other metadata from the book file on disk after you've changed it
  externally (e.g. in Calibre desktop). (#218, requested by @yodatak)

## [v4.0.148] – 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- Sorting the Hidden Books page no longer dumps you into the unfiltered
  library. (#319, reported by @SethMilliken)

## [v4.0.147] – 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- Kobo sync: libraries with thousands of books imported in one batch (all
  sharing one timestamp) now sync completely — previously the device could loop
  on the same batch or skip the remainder. (#347, reported by @andree392)
- Kobo sync: first delivery pass for Magic Shelf membership. (#359)
