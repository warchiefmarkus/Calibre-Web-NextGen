## Switch from upstream CWA

```diff
- image: crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated:latest
+ image: ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
```

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Library, settings, users, OAuth tokens, and KOReader sync state are preserved. Switching back is the reverse one-line change.

## Why this fork exists

CWA has an open PR queue with community-submitted bug fixes that aren't in the latest published image. This build picks the safe ones, ships them in regular releases, and adds fresh fixes for high-impact bugs that don't have an upstream PR yet. Feature work happens here too, driven by what users ask for in the issue tracker.

The data format and configuration are byte-compatible with upstream, so swapping images is reversible and migrations aren't needed in either direction.

---

## What's included

Everything CWA has, plus the patches in [`CHANGES-vs-upstream.md`](CHANGES-vs-upstream.md). A representative slice of fixes that are in this build but not in `crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated:latest`:

- Cover saves from Hardcover, Google Books, iTunes, and Open Library (was returning "not a valid image" since 4.0.6).
- Metadata search and the book-delete button on Safari.
- Generate Kobo Auth Token (was returning a blank page).
- Kobo bookmark sync no longer crashes when the client omits `Location`.
- Auth check added to 14 admin routes (`cwa_logs`, `convert`, `epub_fixer`, and others) that previously didn't require admin.
- Cover-enforcer shell-injection on filenames containing quotes.
- Reverse proxy: user-profile saves honor the path prefix.
- Docker healthcheck follows the `/ → /login` 302 instead of failing on it.
- `.cbr` and `.cbz` use IANA-registered mimetypes in OPDS feeds.
- Higher-resolution covers from Google Books, Amazon, and an iTunes-backed fallback for high-DPI e-readers (Libra Color, etc.).
- Translation PRs merged: ja, fr, cs, hu, zh_Hans, zh_Hant, and others.

---

## Quick start

Requirements: Docker and Docker Compose.

1. Make a folder for your library:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/calibre-web/{config,library,ingest}
   cd ~/calibre-web
   ```

2. Save this as `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   services:
     calibre-web:
       image: ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
       container_name: calibre-web
       environment:
         - PUID=1000
         - PGID=1000
         - TZ=America/New_York   # change to your timezone
       volumes:
         - ./config:/config            # settings, user db, logs
         - ./library:/calibre-library  # books live here
         - ./ingest:/cwa-book-ingest   # drop new books here to import
       ports:
         - 8083:8083
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

3. Start it:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:8083`, log in with `admin` / `admin123`, change the password.

Drop an `.epub` into `./ingest/` and it will appear in your library within a few seconds.

> Files in your library and ingest folders should be owned by your `PUID:PGID` user (1000 by default), not root. If you've copied books in as root, run once: `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ~/calibre-web`.

---

## Full Docker Compose setup

A more complete compose file, with each option documented:

```yaml
services:
  calibre-web:
    image: ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
    container_name: calibre-web
    environment:
      # Match your host user/group so files in your library
      # are writable from both the container and the host.
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000

      # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
      - TZ=America/New_York

      # Override the in-container port if you need to.
      # If set below 1024, also uncomment cap_add below.
      - CWA_PORT_OVERRIDE=8083

      # Set this if your /config or /calibre-library volumes are
      # on an NFS or SMB share. See "Network shares" below.
      - NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=false

      # If you sit behind multiple proxies (e.g. Cloudflare Tunnel
      # then nginx then CWA), set this to the total proxy count so
      # session protection sees the right client IP. Default 1.
      - TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=1

      # Optional: Hardcover API token for the Hardcover metadata
      # provider. Free; sign up at https://hardcover.app/account/api
      # - HARDCOVER_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...

      # Optional: your own ComicVine API key. ComicVine works without
      # one, on a key shared by every install, so it can hit the rate
      # limit. Free; sign up at https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/
      # - COMICVINE_API_KEY=...

    volumes:
      # Settings, user database, logs. Empty folder for new installs;
      # for existing CWA users, point at your existing /config.
      - /path/to/config:/config

      # Your Calibre library. New install? Use an empty folder and
      # CWA will set one up. Existing user? Point at the folder
      # containing your metadata.db.
      - /path/to/library:/calibre-library

      # Drop new books here to import them. WARNING: files in this
      # folder are DELETED after processing. Don't point this at a
      # folder you also use as long-term storage.
      - /path/to/ingest:/cwa-book-ingest

      # Optional: bind your existing Calibre plugins folder
      # - /path/to/calibre-plugins:/config/.config/calibre/plugins

    ports:
      - 8083:8083

    # Uncomment if CWA_PORT_OVERRIDE is below 1024.
    # cap_add:
    #   - NET_BIND_SERVICE

    restart: unless-stopped
```

### What goes in each volume

| Volume | What it is | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/config` | App settings, user accounts, OAuth tokens, KOReader sync state, logs | Empty folder for new installs. Carries over from CWA verbatim. |
| `/calibre-library` | Books and Calibre's `metadata.db` | If empty, CWA creates a fresh library. If multiple `metadata.db` files exist inside, CWA picks the largest. |
| `/cwa-book-ingest` | Drop zone for new books | Files here are **deleted** after processing. Don't park books here long-term. |

> Don't nest the binds. All three should be separate top-level folders. Putting `ingest` inside `library` produces recursive ingest behavior.

---

## First run

1. Open the UI at `http://your-host:8083`.
2. Log in with `admin` / `admin123`.
3. Change the admin password (Profile → Account).
4. Go to Admin → Edit Basic Configuration → Feature Configuration and enable **Allow Uploads**. Without this, the metadata-fetch and cover-from-URL features can't write to your library.
5. Drop a book into your ingest folder. It should appear in the library within a few seconds.

The Admin → Settings panel has many optional toggles (auto-convert formats, automatic backups, EPUB fixer, KOReader sync, OAuth, etc.). The [upstream wiki](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/wiki) is the source of truth for those; this fork doesn't change them.

---

## Updating

Calibre-Web NextGen ships new versions regularly — often weekly. Updating means pulling the new image and recreating the container; your library, settings and reading progress live in the mounted volumes, so they're left untouched.

**Update once, by hand:**

```bash
docker compose pull calibre-web && docker compose up -d calibre-web
```

(Use your own service name if it isn't `calibre-web`.)

**Update automatically** with [Watchtower](https://github.com/nicholas-fedor/watchtower) (the maintained fork). Add it alongside CWA and label the CWA service so Watchtower only ever touches this one container — your other containers are left alone:

```yaml
services:
  calibre-web:
    image: ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
    labels: ["com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"]
    # ...rest of your config

  watchtower:
    image: nickfedor/watchtower
    volumes: ["/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"]
    command: --label-enable --cleanup --interval 86400   # check daily, remove old images
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The in-app **Admin → NextGen Settings → Automatic updates** panel shows these same steps, and the "Update available" banner has an **Update now** button that gives the right command for your setup (Compose, `docker run`, Unraid, Portainer/Synology).

### Running with Podman

Calibre-Web NextGen is a standard OCI image, so it runs under Podman too — same image, no separate build:

```bash
podman run -d --name calibre-web \
  -e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000 -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -p 8083:8083 \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  -v /path/to/library:/calibre-library \
  -v /path/to/ingest:/cwa-book-ingest \
  ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
```

Rootless Podman remaps user IDs, so if the container can't write to your volumes, add `--userns=keep-id` (or run it rootful). Podman also has native automatic updates (`podman auto-update`) with rollback — a step-by-step guide is coming once we've verified it against this image.

---

## Migrating

### From upstream CWA

One line. Stop the container, swap the image, start it.

```diff
- image: crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated:latest
+ image: ghcr.io/new-usemame/calibre-web-nextgen:latest
```

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Settings, users, OAuth tokens, and KOReader sync state are preserved. The data format is identical, so reverting is the reverse one-line change.

### From stock Calibre-Web

1. Stop your existing Calibre-Web container.
2. In the new compose file, point `/config` at the same `/config` folder you used for Calibre-Web.
3. Whatever you bound as `/books` in Calibre-Web should be bound as `/calibre-library` here.
4. Pick an empty folder for `/cwa-book-ingest` (it's CWA-specific; no equivalent in stock CW).
5. Start the container.

Users, settings, and shelves carry over. The first launch takes a few extra seconds while CWA registers itself with the existing app database.

---

## Pair with Shelfmark

[Shelfmark](https://github.com/calibrain/shelfmark) by @calibrain is a self-hosted book search and request interface. Users search across torrent, usenet, IRC, and direct sources from a single UI; Shelfmark hands the download to your client of choice and drops the finished file straight into the CWA ingest folder, where this build picks it up automatically. Multi-user requests are built in, so you can share an instance with household readers and approve their picks.

Add it alongside `calibre-web` in the same compose file:

```yaml
  shelfmark:
    image: ghcr.io/calibrain/shelfmark:latest
    container_name: shelfmark
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - SEARCH_MODE=universal

      # Point Shelfmark at CWA's app.db (read-only mount below) so users
      # log in to Shelfmark with their existing CWA credentials.
      - CWA_DB_PATH=/auth/cw-config/app.db

      # Optional: shows a "Library" button in Shelfmark's header that
      # links back to this CWA instance.
      - CALIBRE_WEB_URL=http://your-host:8083

    volumes:
      - /path/to/shelfmark-config:/config

      # Read-only mount of your CWA config dir for the auth integration.
      - /path/to/cwa-config:/auth/cw-config:ro

      # Shelfmark's destination folder = CWA's ingest folder.
      # Downloads land here and this build ingests them on the next watch tick.
      - /path/to/cwa-ingest:/books

      # If you use a torrent or usenet client, mount its downloads dir
      # at the same path you mounted in the client itself, so Shelfmark
      # can locate the completed file.
      - /path/to/downloads:/downloads

    ports:
      - 8084:8084
    restart: unless-stopped
```

After Shelfmark starts, open it and pick **Settings → Security → Authentication Method → Calibre-Web Database**, then **Sync from Calibre-Web** to import users. The [Shelfmark docs](https://github.com/calibrain/shelfmark#readme) cover Prowlarr, qBittorrent, SABnzbd, and IRC source setup.

> Shelfmark went into maintenance-only status in May 2026; the v1.3.0 build is stable and the integration with CWA is settled, but new feature work upstream has paused. If you want to pin for reproducibility, use `ghcr.io/calibrain/shelfmark:v1.3.0` instead of `:latest`.

---

## Common configurations

### Network shares (NFS, SMB, ZFS)

If `/config` or `/calibre-library` lives on a network share, set:

```yaml
- NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true
```

This:
- Disables SQLite WAL mode (NFS and SMB don't reliably support it; without this you'll see "database is locked").
- Skips the recursive ownership-fix at startup (slow on NFS, often fails on SMB).
- Switches the ingest watcher from inotify to polling (network-FS inotify events are unreliable).

Tested and supported. Ingest is a few seconds slower; everything else behaves the same.

> If files end up owned by root after a copy: this build chowns files back to your `PUID:PGID` after each metadata-change cycle, but if you've copied files in as root before upgrading, run once: `docker exec calibre-web chown -R abc:abc /calibre-library` (replace `abc` if you've customized the user).

### Calibre desktop coexistence

If you want to open the same library in calibre desktop while calibre-web-nextgen is running, set both:

```yaml
- NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true
- DESKTOP_COMPAT_MODE=true
```

By default, calibre-web-nextgen holds a single SQLite connection open for the life of the process. That blocks calibre desktop from opening the library — on calibre 9.9.0 + macOS it crashes without an error dialog. `DESKTOP_COMPAT_MODE=true` switches to per-request connections so the file lock is released between web requests, letting calibre desktop open the database in the gaps.

Changes you make in calibre desktop (edits, adds, deletes) appear in the web UI on the next page load — no restart needed.

Trade-offs:
- Each web request pays a small extra overhead to open and close the database connection.
- If calibre desktop is actively writing when a web request comes in, the request waits up to 60 seconds for the lock. Heavy simultaneous use can slow the web UI.
- Designed for home-server use where calibre desktop is opened occasionally for bulk edits, not for concurrent heavy use of both.

### Calibre plugins (DeDRM and others)

calibre-web-nextgen doesn't ship any Calibre plugins, but it can load ones you install yourself — the same plugin `.zip` files Calibre desktop uses. This is how you add things like DRM removal (DeDRM, Obok) or `.acsm` fulfillment (the ACSM Input plugin): you supply the plugins, and they run automatically during ingest, library conversion, and metadata embedding.

1. Turn the feature on in your compose environment, then restart:

   ```yaml
   - CWA_CALIBRE_USER_PLUGINS=true
   ```

2. Copy the plugin `.zip` files into the `plugins` folder inside your config volume — from the host that's `<your config folder>/.config/calibre/plugins/` (the folder is created automatically once the option is on).

3. Restart the container again. Each plugin is registered at startup; confirm with:

   ```
   docker logs calibre-web 2>&1 | grep "Registered Calibre plugin"
   ```

Plugins that need keys or an account (DeDRM wants your device keys, ACSM Input wants an Adobe login) keep their settings in files next to the zips. Easiest path: configure the plugin in Calibre desktop on your computer first, then copy its settings files (e.g. `plugins/dedrm.json`, the `plugins/DeACSM/` folder) from your desktop Calibre configuration folder into the same container `plugins/` folder and restart.

To add another plugin **after** the first batch is registered, drop the zip in the same folder and run:

```
docker exec -e HOME=/config calibre-web /opt/calibre/calibre-customize -a "/config/.config/calibre/plugins/<plugin file>.zip"
```

The feature is off by default because it runs third-party plugin code inside your container — only install plugins you trust, from their official release pages. Which plugins are appropriate to use is your call.

### Reverse proxy with a prefix

To deploy CWA behind a reverse proxy, configure your reverse proxy to forward
requests to the CWA service and handle the path prefix (e.g. `/cwa/`). For
instance, with Nginx:

```
location /cwa/ {
    proxy_pass http://calibre-web-automated:8083/;

    proxy_set_header Host              $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

The trailing slash on `proxy_pass` matters: it strips `/cwa/` before the request
reaches CWA. The headers are written out rather than pulled in with
`include proxy_params;` because that file ships with Debian and Ubuntu's nginx
package only — the official `nginx` Docker images don't have it, and nginx
refuses to start when the include is missing.

You must also configure the application with the external URL prefix by setting
the following environment variable in your Docker compose file:

```yaml
environment:
  - PROXY_SCRIPT_NAME=/cwa
```

Leave the trailing slash off `PROXY_SCRIPT_NAME` — CWA joins it to each path
directly, so `/cwa/` would generate doubled-slash URLs.

This ensures that CWA correctly generates URLs when it is served from the
prefix path instead of the web server root.

For TLS, upload limits, and the larger proxy buffers Kobo sync needs, see
[`examples/nginx-reverse-proxy.conf`](examples/nginx-reverse-proxy.conf) — the
settings there apply to a prefixed deployment too.

### Reverse proxy / Cloudflare Tunnel

Behind multiple proxies (e.g. Cloudflare Tunnel then nginx then CWA), set the proxy count:

```yaml
- TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=2
```

Without this, CWA may see different client IPs across requests and trigger Session Protection warnings, forcing re-login on every page load. Default is `1`.

### Hardcover metadata provider

[Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) is a free metadata provider. To enable it:

1. Sign up at https://hardcover.app and grab an API token at https://hardcover.app/account/api.
2. Add to your compose env:

   ```yaml
   - HARDCOVER_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...
   ```

   Or paste it into Admin → Edit Basic Configuration → Hardcover API Key in the UI.
3. Restart the container.

Hardcover then appears in the Fetch Metadata modal.

If you set the token through the `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` environment variable, the **Hardcover API Key** field in the admin UI stays empty — that field only shows a key entered through the UI, and an environment-supplied token is not echoed back into the page. The admin page identifies whether `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` or `HARDCOVER_TOKEN_FILE` is active without displaying its value; a key typed into the field overrides either environment source.

To keep the token out of your compose file entirely, point `HARDCOVER_TOKEN_FILE` at a file containing just the token (docker-secrets style):

```yaml
   - HARDCOVER_TOKEN_FILE=/run/secrets/hardcover_token
```

Precedence: UI-configured key → `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` → `HARDCOVER_TOKEN_FILE`.

Enable the server-wide integration once under Admin → Edit Basic Configuration → **Enable Hardcover Sync**. This single switch controls both scheduled Hardcover ID fetching and Kobo/KOReader reading-progress sync. A declarative deployment can override it instead:

```yaml
   - HARDCOVER_SYNC_ENABLED=true
```

Accepted true values are `true`, `1`, `yes`, and `on`; false values are `false`, `0`, `no`, and `off` (case-insensitive). When the variable is set, the UI shows the effective state but leaves changes to the deployment configuration.

### External book ratings

Book detail pages can load cached aggregate ratings and popularity counters from
Goodreads, Hardcover, Google Books, and Open Library. Sources are displayed
separately; the application does not average ratings from different communities.

Matching order is: provider-specific ID, exact ISBN, original/canonical title
and author, then the localized Calibre title and author. Goodreads structured
book data can resolve a translated edition to the original work and enrich the
queries sent to the other providers. You can also store explicit Calibre
identifiers named `original-title` and `original-author`; these are always tried
before the localized metadata.

Hardcover uses the token configured above. Open Library needs no key. Goodreads
uses the same public structured-data endpoint as its web client, with an HTML
fallback; either surface may temporarily reject automated requests. Google Books
supports anonymous requests, but deployments
that encounter quota or rate-limit responses should set an API key either in
Admin → Edit Basic Configuration or through the environment:

```yaml
- GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=your-google-books-api-key
```

Successful results are cached for seven days. New uploads and watch-folder
imports queue a non-blocking background lookup after metadata enrichment, so
catalog cards normally have a rating before their detail page is first opened.
The library, search, shelf, and smart-shelf APIs attach cached rating summaries
with one batch query; cover previews render the selected source as a compact
responsive star badge. A refresh button on the book page forces a new lookup,
and provider failures do not prevent results from the other sources from being
shown.

### KOReader sync

CWA has built-in KOReader progress sync; no separate kosync server is needed.

1. In KOReader, install the CWA plugin: visit `http://your-cwa:8083/kosync` for download and install instructions.
2. Point the plugin at `http://your-cwa:8083` and log in with your CWA username and password.
3. Read on any device. Progress syncs back to CWA, and from there to Kobo if Kobo sync is enabled.

**Keeping the plugin updated.** KOReader's [Updates Manager](https://github.com/advokatb/updatesmanager.koplugin) and [appstore.koplugin](https://github.com/kaz-utashiro/appstore.koplugin) can both update the plugin in place. Point either at the plugin's own repository, [`new-usemame/cwasync.koplugin`](https://github.com/new-usemame/cwasync.koplugin/releases) — not at this one. The plugin publishes a release only when the plugin itself changes, and its version is the server version it last changed in, so it can legitimately sit behind your server version; that alone doesn't mean anything is wrong. With the plugin repository configured, a check that reports no new release means the plugin stream has nothing newer.

If your update manager is still pointed at this repository, switch it. That setup keeps working — a release that changes the plugin attaches the plugin download — but the plugin only appears on those releases, which is easy to misread as "no update available". The download on `/kosync` always serves the plugin bundled with your running server if you would rather update by hand.

**Matching filenames across devices (OPDS downloads).** If you download books to KOReader over OPDS and sync progress by filename across several e-readers, turn on **Use server filenames** in KOReader's OPDS catalog settings (the checkbox when you add or edit the catalog). By default KOReader names a downloaded file `Author - Title.epub` from the catalog entry, which differs from the on-disk library name `Title - Author.epub` and forces a manual rename. CWA already sends the library name in the download's `Content-Disposition` header; with **Use server filenames** on, KOReader uses that name, so the file matches your library and your other devices without renaming.

### Moon+ Reader WebDAV progress

Moon+ Reader can store per-book position files on WebDAV. Open **Account →
Moon+ Reader sync** to configure a WebDAV URL, username, password, and optional
cache path. The password is encrypted with the installation key and is never
returned to the browser after it is saved.

Synchronization is bidirectional. A manual **Sync now** performs a complete
reconciliation, and a one-minute background poll detects changes made by Moon+
or another Calibre reader. Foliate writes enqueue an immediate per-book WebDAV
reconciliation after the native Calibre position is saved.

Moon+ `.po` files are decoded as `deviceId*chapter@split#offset:percent%` (or
`deviceId*page:percent%` for PDF). The device id prevents self-echoes; freshness
comes from the WebDAV ETag/modification time and Calibre's native position epoch.
Moon+ is the primary reader and wins timestamp ties. Updates use conditional
WebDAV PUTs so a concurrent Moon save cannot be overwritten.

For FB2 and EPUB, CWNG reproduces Moon's chapter model and its exact HTML
splitter. Moon chooses a 150,000, 400,000, or 1,000,000-character split size from
the Android memory class; CWNG infers that profile from an existing `.po` and
writes a real `chapter@split#offset` locator. On import, the structural locator is
used when it agrees with Moon's one-decimal percentage and the percentage is the
safe fallback when a local book or split profile cannot be verified.

Foliate sends visible text with each position update, allowing the WebDAV writer
to locate the same paragraph rather than converting only from a coarse fraction.
Older web-reader positions without a text anchor are not allowed to overwrite an
existing Moon file; they wait for the next real Foliate relocation. Other native
Calibre devices use a chapter-aware fallback for supported formats. PDF uses the
stored page locator; unsupported reflowable formats are deferred instead of
writing a false zero locator.

The cache path may be left empty while configuring the connection, but a folder
must be selected before synchronization. Use **Find Moon sync files** to perform
a bounded WebDAV scan for every `.Moon+/Cache` collection. The page lists each
location with its `.po` file count and newest modification time; selecting one
fills the cache-path field. The scan prioritizes likely `Moon`, `Books`, and
`Apps` paths, is limited to five levels and 400 collections, and explicitly
reports when that safety limit makes the result potentially incomplete.

Books are matched using the exact Calibre filename, a unique normalized filename
stem, and finally a SHA-256 comparison when Moon+ reads a renamed copy stored at
the WebDAV root. Ambiguous matches are skipped and shown in the synchronization
summary rather than being assigned to the wrong book.

The WebDAV connection is always made through HTTP/WebDAV, even when it points
back to the same host. Redirects are rejected so Basic Auth credentials cannot
be forwarded to another origin. Directory listings, position files, and
checksum downloads have explicit size and timeout limits.

### Kobo sync

Read your CWA library on a Kobo e-reader, with reading progress syncing both ways. Sync runs against your own server, so your library never leaves your network.

1. In Admin → Edit Basic Configuration, turn on **Enable Kobo sync**.
2. Open your user page (Admin → Users → your user, or your own profile) and click **Create/View** next to **Kobo Sync Token**. The dialog shows the exact `api_endpoint=` line for your account.
3. Plug the Kobo into a computer over USB and open `.kobo/Kobo/Kobo eReader.conf` in a text editor. Add or replace the `api_endpoint=` line with the one from the dialog, save, and eject the device cleanly.
4. On the Kobo, sync. Books on your Kobo Sync shelves appear on the device, and progress flows back to CWA.

> ### ℹ️ Where your highlights travel, and how to check
>
> `api_endpoint` routes **library sync**. Your **highlights and notes** travel over a separate
> reading-services channel governed by a different key, `reading_services_host`.
>
> **You should not normally need to touch that key.** CWA advertises the right value during sync
> initialization, and a device that performs a full initialization against your server adopts it on
> its own. That is the supported path.
>
> 🚨 **Do not hand-edit `reading_services_host` in the conf file.** Doing so has been measured to
> break syncing outright on at least one device — a Kobo Clara BW on firmware 4.42.23291 began
> failing every sync with `FailedSync / WebRequestErr`, and recovered only when the key was set back
> to `readingservices.kobo.com`. A Kobo Libra Colour on 4.45.23697 is unaffected and routes
> annotations through CWA happily, so this is **not** universal — but we cannot yet predict which
> devices tolerate it, and the failure leaves you with a reader that will not sync and no obvious
> cause.
>
> **If your sync has already broken after editing that key:** set `reading_services_host` back to
> `readingservices.kobo.com`, save, eject cleanly, and sync again.
>
> **To see whether annotations are reaching CWA**, make a highlight on the device, sync, and watch:
>
> ```bash
> docker logs -f calibre-web 2>&1 | grep -iE "annotations|reading services"
> ```
>
> Silence means your highlights are going to Kobo's servers rather than yours. The safe way to
> change that is to get the device to perform a **full initialization** against CWA — re-generate
> the Kobo Sync Token and re-pair — rather than editing the key by hand.
>
> This matters because CWA's protection against a Kobo deleting its own highlights after a sync
> (upstream [calibre-web#2610](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/issues/2610)) works by
> answering that channel, and it cannot protect a request it never receives. Until the device is
> routing annotations through CWA, treat highlights made on it as device-only and back them up.

To confirm the device is reaching your server, watch the logs while you sync — you should see requests to `/kobo/<token>/v1/...`:

```bash
docker logs -f calibre-web 2>&1 | grep /kobo/
```

**Behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Nginx Proxy Manager, Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel)**

Kobo devices sync over HTTPS, so the `api_endpoint` has to be your public `https://` address. Put a proxy with a valid certificate in front and point it at the container's plain HTTP port:

- Proxy target is `http://<container-host>:8083`. The proxy terminates TLS on 443; the connection from the proxy to CWA stays HTTP. WebSocket support is not needed for Kobo sync.
- Generate the token while visiting CWA through the HTTPS address, so the `api_endpoint=` line the dialog shows already carries your public hostname.
- If you stack proxies (for example Cloudflare Tunnel in front of nginx), set [`TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT`](#reverse-proxy--cloudflare-tunnel) to the number of proxies.

**nginx buffer sizes (important for Kobo sync)**

Kobo's `/v1/library/sync` response carries large headers (auth, sync tokens, library state). Nginx's default `proxy_buffer_size` (4 KB) and `proxy_buffers` (8 × 4 KB) are too small; the response is silently dropped before it reaches the device, and the Kobo shows *"Sync failed, please try again"* with **no error in the CWA log**. The nginx error log shows `upstream sent too big header while reading response header from upstream`. Add these to the `location /` block proxying CWA:

```nginx
proxy_buffer_size       32k;
proxy_buffers           4 32k;
proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k;
```

(Larger libraries may need `128k / 4 256k / 256k`.) Reload nginx after the change. On Synology DSM, the built-in reverse-proxy GUI doesn't expose these directives — drop a custom config at `/etc/nginx/conf.d/http.calibre_web.conf` that mirrors the DSM entry plus the buffer lines, then disable the DSM entry. DSM rewrites `nginx.conf` on reboot, so a Task Scheduler boot-event job that runs `nginx -s reload` reapplies the custom file. Nginx Proxy Manager users: add the three lines under the proxy host's *Advanced* tab.

See [`examples/nginx-reverse-proxy.conf`](examples/nginx-reverse-proxy.conf) for a complete reference snippet.

**If you keep a Kobo account signed in**

Signing into a Kobo account, or doing a factory reset, can rewrite the `api_endpoint=` line back to Kobo's own server, which sends sync to Kobo instead of your library. After signing in, re-check the conf line over USB and set it back if it changed. Many sideloaded setups sign out of the Kobo account so the device stops resetting the endpoint.

To keep the Kobo Store and your library working at the same time, turn on **Proxy unknown requests to Kobo Store** in Admin → Edit Basic Configuration. With it off (the default), any request CWA doesn't recognize gets an empty response — fine for a sideload-only device, but store features won't load.

## Troubleshooting

### "Cover-file is not a valid image file, or could not be stored"

Fixed in v4.0.13 and later. If you're still seeing it after upgrading, you probably have `root:root`-owned book directories from a pre-fix install. Run once:

```bash
docker exec calibre-web chown -R abc:abc /calibre-library
```

### "Generate Kobo Auth Token" returns a blank page

Fixed in v4.0.14 and later. Upgrade the image.

### Kobo says "Sync failed, please try again"

Almost always one of these:

1. The device isn't reaching your server. The `api_endpoint=` line in `.kobo/Kobo/Kobo eReader.conf` must point at your CWA address (not `storeapi.kobo.com`), and that address must be reachable over HTTPS. See [Kobo sync](#kobo-sync).
2. A Kobo account is signed in and **Proxy unknown requests to Kobo Store** is off, so the device's store calls get an empty response mid-sync. Turn that setting on, or sign out of the Kobo account on the device.
3. Behind a reverse proxy, the proxy can't reach the container. Confirm the proxy target is `http://<host>:8083` and that the certificate is valid.
4. **nginx is silently dropping the sync response because its default buffers are too small for Kobo's library-sync headers.** The CWA log shows the request arriving but nothing else; the nginx error log shows `upstream sent too big header`. Add `proxy_buffer_size 32k; proxy_buffers 4 32k; proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k;` to the proxy location. See the [nginx buffer sizes](#kobo-sync) note in the Kobo sync section.

### "Database is locked" / app frozen

If your library is on a network share, set `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true` (see above). On local disk, this usually means a previous container shutdown was unclean: restart Docker, then the container.

### Session Protection warnings, forced re-login on every page

Set `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` to match your proxy depth. See [Reverse proxy](#reverse-proxy--cloudflare-tunnel).

### Books in `/cwa-book-ingest` aren't picked up

Three common causes:

1. Files owned by root. Make sure ingest files are owned by your `PUID:PGID` user.
2. Watcher missed them. Click the **Refresh Library** button on the navbar; it does a one-shot scan.
3. Format isn't allowed. Check Admin → CWA Settings → Ingest for your allowed formats.

### Default login isn't working

The defaults are `admin` / `admin123` (lowercase). If you've already changed the password and forgotten it: stop the container, delete `config/app.db`, and restart. This resets the database. User accounts are lost; the library itself is untouched.

## Differences from upstream

### Managed bare-metal branch

This checkout uses the shared custom branch name `legion-managed`. `origin` is the `warchiefmarkus/Calibre-Web-NextGen` fork and `upstream` is the fetch-only `new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen` repository. The local deployment pairs this UI with CalibreMCP and the system Calibre application. See [docs/MANAGED_FORK.md](docs/MANAGED_FORK.md) for the component boundaries, reader/RAG behavior, verification gates, and upstream merge procedure.

| Behavior | Upstream CWA `:latest` | This build |
|---|---|---|
| Cover saves from Hardcover/Google Books/iTunes/Open Library | Returns "not a valid image" | Saves and persists |
| Generate Kobo Auth Token | Blank page | Works |
| Safari metadata search | Silent 400 | Works |
| Safari book-delete button | Broken since the Feb-4 commit | Works |
| Kobo bookmark sync with missing `Location` | Crashes | Tolerates |
| `/kobo_auth/generate_auth_token` IDOR | Open (any user can mint another user's token) | Closed |
| Reverse-proxy user-profile updates | Drops path prefix | Honors `getPath()` |
| Docker healthcheck on `/ → /login` 302 | Trips on `curl -f` | Uses dedicated endpoint with service health checks |
| `.cbr` / `.cbz` OPDS mimetypes | Non-IANA | IANA-compliant |
| Cover resolution on high-DPI readers | Often 290×475 (Hardcover thumbnail) | 1000×1500+ via booster |
| Admin routes (`cwa_logs`, `convert`, `epub_fixer`, …) | 14 unauthenticated | All require admin |
| Translations: ja, fr, cs, hu, zh_Hans, zh_Hant | Open in PRs | Merged |

Backports are conservative. Anything that touches auth, schema, or dependencies gets a manual review before merging.

## Contributing

- **Bug reports:** [open a bug issue](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Reproduction steps, version tag, and a `docker logs` snippet help a lot.
- **Feature requests:** [open a feature issue](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). The bar is low — bug reports get prioritized for code work, but feature requests shape what gets looked at when the bug queue is quiet, and they help upstream see what users actually want. Don't worry about whether it's "in scope"; just file it.
- **Pull requests:** welcome. The merge bar is "doesn't break anything that currently works." Changes touching auth, schema, or dependencies get a closer review. Backports keep the original author's handle in the commit message.
- **CWA PR authors with stalled work upstream:** if you'd like your PR shipped here too, open an issue or send the PR our way.

## Supporting the project

<!-- funding-stats:start (regenerate with scripts/funding-stats.sh — do not hand-edit) -->
Since May 2026: **188 releases, 673 merged pull requests, 262 issues closed, and 155 contributors credited by name.**
<!-- funding-stats:end -->

This build exists to ship community bug fixes on a fast, regular release cadence — real fixes,
written by real people, packaged so they reach users quickly. It complements the upstream
projects it builds on, and their maintainers have our respect and our credits below.

**Nothing here is paywalled and nothing ever will be.** No sponsor-only features, no private
Discord, no early access, no "pro" tier. Every line is GPL-3.0 and free whether you contribute
or not. Sponsorship supports one thing: keeping this going.

If the project has been useful to you, a few dollars is a fair trade and genuinely appreciated.
If it hasn't, that's completely fine — it stays free either way.

- **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/new-usemame)** — one-time or monthly. GitHub takes 0%, so all of it arrives.
- **[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/calibrewebnextgen)** — the same thing, if you already have an account there.

The most useful thing you can do costs nothing: [file a bug](https://github.com/new-usemame/Calibre-Web-NextGen/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) when something breaks. That helps more than a few dollars does.

## How AI is used

The codebase itself is Calibre-Web and Calibre-Web-Automated — written over many years by their
human maintainers and contributors, who are credited in [Credits](#credits). What this fork adds
on top — its own fixes, their regression tests, the changelog and most issue replies — is largely
produced by an AI assistant working from a written brief, with human review gates: merges require
CI plus a regression test verified to fail without the fix, and anything adding a dependency,
changing a licence or introducing an external URL is decided by a person.

**The shipped application itself contains no AI:** no model dependency, no inference call, no
telemetry, and your library is not sent anywhere.
