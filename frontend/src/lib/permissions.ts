 * (`cps/templates/layout.html`: `current_user.role_upload() and g.allow_upload`):
 * the per-user role AND the admin's instance-wide "Enable Uploads" switch.
 *
 * `features.uploading` is absent on servers older than the fix, and absent
 * means ON — it matches the column default (`config_uploading` defaults to 1),
 * so an older server keeps working instead of hiding upload everywhere. That is
 * the opposite of the opt-in flags in `ServerFeatures`, which default off.
 *
 * UI-gating only. Enforcement is server-side on each endpoint
 * (`cps/api/upload.py`, `cps/editbooks.py::upload_required`).
