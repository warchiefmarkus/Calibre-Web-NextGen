   "What's New" — the in-app feature log the SPA renders on /whats-new.

   This is the SINGLE SOURCE for the reader-facing feature log. It is the
   humanized, deep-linked projection of CHANGELOG.md, grouped by published
   release (newest first). Keeping it as data — not hand-written JSX per
   release — is what makes it AI-iterable: the `whats-new-populate` skill
   (~/.claude/skills/whats-new-populate/) prepends a new WHATS_NEW[0] block on
   every public release, one WhatsNewItem per user-facing change.

   COPY STANDARD (see notes/WHATS-NEW-FEATURE-DESIGN.md — obey it on every add):
     - Lead with the reader benefit, not the mechanism.
     - Name the problem it solves in plain words, then how to use it.
     - 1–3 sentences. If it needs more, it's two items.
     - No AI tells, no marketing fluff, no exclamation storms. Smart-reader
       register: warm, precise, concise. English-authored (chrome is localized,
       entries are not — the page says so).
     - Credit no contributors here (that's release notes / outreach).

   DEEP LINKS: `link.to` is an in-app SPA path (resolved under the /app router
   base by wouter). It MUST be a route that exists in App.tsx. Omit `link`
   entirely when no navigable surface fits (a per-book screen with no universal
   entry point, a logged-out page, or a pure backend fix) — never fake one.
