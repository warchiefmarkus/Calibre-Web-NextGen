/*
 * "Recent" — the Library opens on what this reader has been reading, then the
 * books they have not read in the order those were added.
 *
 * Why this is an e2e spec and not a unit test. The order itself is SQL and is
 * covered where it can be driven through every writer at once
 * (tests/unit/test_library_recent_sort.py). What only a browser can show is the
 * half that ships to the user: which sort the SPA ASKS the server for on a cold
 * load, whether the menu is showing the sort the list is actually in, and
 * whether a value left in the old storage key suppresses the new default. Each
 * of those has a mode where the server is right and the page is wrong.
 *
 * This spec also carries the first-paint claim that
 * tests/unit/test_753_default_sort_freshness.py can only pin as source text:
 * the listing request the SPA issues IS the default, so a view that opened on
 * the wrong sort would be visible here as the sort it asked for, and a
 * post-mount correction would be visible as a second listing request.
 *
 * FIXTURE — a reader of its own. Recency is per-reader state, so every test
 * here runs as a freshly created account (the `secondaryUser` fixture), which
 * is deleted again when the test ends. The shared seed login is wrong for this
 * spec in both directions: other specs WRITE that account while this one reads
 * it — default-library-view.spec.ts saves a default library filter on it, and
 * while one is saved the library grid is a filtered view, so this spec's cold
 * load sees no unfiltered listing at all (MEASURED: running those two files in
 * one desktop invocation fails this spec every time) — and this spec's own
 * writes are reading history, which is exactly the input the sort under test
 * consumes. A private account also hands the fixture a known starting point: no
 * activity anywhere, so "this book leads because it was read" cannot be left
 * over from an earlier run, and the no-activity case is itself asserted below.
 *
 * The book given reading activity is taken from the FAR END of the newest-first
 * listing — the oldest-added book in the library — so "it is first because it
 * was read" cannot be confused with "it is first because it is newest".
 * Reading is recorded through the route the web reader itself posts to.
