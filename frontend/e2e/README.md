# SPA end-to-end harness

Layer 2 of the verification system (see `notes/verify/FAILURE-MODES.md` + `MATRIX.md` in the workspace).
Drives the **real SPA in a running container** across the matrix cells a UI change can break, so the
Class-1 (full-client-flow), mobile-reflow, default-state, and console-error regressions that shipped in
v4.1.x can't ship silently again.

## Run it

The harness expects the app already running. Locally that's `cwn-local`:

```bash
# from repo root: build + start cwn-local if not up
cd ../.. && docker build -t calibre-web-nextgen:local repo && \
  docker compose -f local-dev/docker-compose.local.yml up -d   # serves :8086

cd repo/frontend
npm run test:e2e            # desktop + mobile, against http://localhost:8086
npm run test:e2e:report     # open the HTML report
```

Env knobs: `E2E_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:8086`), `E2E_USER`/`E2E_PASS` (default
`admin`/`admin123`), `E2E_SUBPATH_URL` (set to the `cwn-nginx-571` rig `http://localhost:8087` to run the
reverse-proxy project).

In CI, a same-repository PR whose concurrency/engine dependency closure changed runs this suite as a
hard gate against `sha-<PR head>` — the dev-image workflow builds that exact commit and the test workflow
waits for, then pins, its manifest digest. Frontend-only PRs retain the cheaper SPA-overlay route. To run
the lane outside its automatic path classes, use **Actions → Test Suite → Run workflow** with `run_e2e`
enabled. This is a two-dispatch escape hatch for an old ref: first dispatch **Build & Push - Dev - Split
Strategy** with both `ref=<old ref>` and a non-main `branch=` value, then dispatch **Test Suite** for the
same ref with `run_e2e` enabled. Omitting `branch=` while dispatching from `main` advances the floating
`:dev` channel to that old build; the immutable `sha-<commit>` tag needed by E2E is published either way.
Manual E2E fails immediately when that tag was not prepared, rather than waiting for a producer that was
never started or falling back to another backend. Automatic `dev`-branch E2E likewise fails fast with a
stated reason because the dev-image workflow currently produces push images for `main`, not `dev`.

The concurrency set is an intentionally bounded architectural approximation. Local imports are followed
downward from explicit request/engine roots, including the high-write `cps/web.py` and `cps/kobo.py`
surfaces; reverse dependents cannot be discovered by that traversal and must be added as roots or package
prefixes. The whole `cps/api/` blueprint tree is therefore protected explicitly: its registration in
`cps/main.py` points toward the handlers, opposite to the import direction walked by the classifier. The
two-level cutoff only bounds each root's dependency fan-out—it is not what excludes reverse dependents.
At this revision the derived set is 156 of 222 local Python modules (the closure correctly picks
up `cps/services/device_delivery.py` through the book-action request path, and this branch's
`cps/user_preferences.py` through the account API path). Measured at `origin/main`
`e6298e0d560b`, the previous and expanded policies each fired on 26 of the latest 100 first-parent commits;
protecting `cps/api/` added zero historical gate runs in that sample.

## What it covers (projects = matrix axes)

| Project | Axis | Guards |
|---|---|---|
| `setup` | — | logs in once via the real UI, saves session |
| `desktop` | 1280×800 | full flow + a11y baseline |
| `mobile` | 375×667 (chromium emulation) | drawer reachability + scroll-lock (#576), no h-overflow (#288) |
| `subpath` | reverse proxy (opt-in) | assets/nav under a base path (v4.1.1 reader 404, #571) |

Specs: `browse.spec.ts` (grid→detail→reader flow + clean console + default-state), `mobile.spec.ts`
(drawer), `a11y.spec.ts` (WCAG 2.2 AA gate — axe across every route, **fails on any critical OR
serious** violation, `KNOWN` allowlist must stay empty; plus keyboard/focus invariants: skip link,
single `<main>`, no nested-card tab stop, mobile drawer inert/trapped), `subpath.spec.ts` (base-path).
Grow the a11y gate via the `CWNG_a11y` skill.

## Extending it (keep it honest)

- **Add a spec for every UI bug you fix** — it should fail on the pre-fix build and pass after. That's the
  regression contract.
- **No `data-testid` yet** — selectors are role/text/`href`-based on purpose (doubles as a11y pressure). Add
  a `data-testid` only when a flow is genuinely unselectable otherwise.
- **Shrink `KNOWN_CRITICAL`** in `a11y.spec.ts` as the A11Y-AUDIT findings land — the goal is an empty
  allowlist, not a growing one. A quarantined violation is a named debt, never a silenced red.
- **Theme axis** is not live yet (the SPA ships a single dark theme). Add a theme project when `tokens.css`
  gains a light/other `:root` block.

### Backend capability probes

A frontend/full-stack PR can run on a frontend-only or fork lane whose digest-pinned backend predates a
new route. Use `requireRouteCapability` from `e2e/capabilities.ts` in `beforeEach` to probe route presence
with Flask's automatic `OPTIONS` response and skip with an explicit, self-retiring reason:

```ts
await requireRouteCapability(page.request, {
  method: 'DELETE',
  path: '/api/v1/widgets/1',
  name: 'widget deletion',
  pinnedBy: 'tests/unit/test_widgets.py::test_delete_route_is_registered',
});
```

The probe is presence-only: never send a real payload or interpret a handler body in the helper. A present
but incorrect route must run and fail the real spec. Every probe must name an independent Fast Tests test
that pins route registration on every PR; otherwise the skip would create a silent coverage hole.
Use a feature-specific mutation method (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`), not `GET`/`HEAD`: the classic
UI catch-all advertises read methods for unknown paths, so treating those as a presence signal would be a
false positive. The helper rejects that ambiguous probe shape loudly.

### A second user in one spec

Import `test` and `expect` from `e2e/fixtures.ts` only in a spec that needs multiple users. Requesting the
`secondaryUser` fixture creates a unique non-admin viewer through the running container's real admin API,
logs it into a separate browser context through the production auth endpoint, confirms that session in the
SPA, and deletes it after the test:

```ts
import { test, expect } from './fixtures';

test('personal state is isolated', async ({ page, secondaryUser }) => {
  // `page` is the unchanged primary admin session; each request context owns
  // its browser context's independent cookie jar.
  const adminMe = await page.request.get('/api/v1/auth/me').then((r) => r.json());
  const otherMe = await secondaryUser.page.request.get('/api/v1/auth/me').then((r) => r.json());
  expect(adminMe.name).not.toBe(otherMe.name);
  expect(adminMe.role.admin).toBe(true);
  expect(otherMe.role.admin).toBe(false);
});
```

The fixture writes a durable ownership intent under the user's CWNG cache before
creating the account. Its normal teardown deletes through an API request context
that does not depend on the closing page. If the runner is killed, the next
`global.setup.ts` run reclaims only exact registered accounts whose local owner
PID is no longer alive; live parallel workers remain outside the deletion set.

The fixture is test-scoped and lazy, so the existing suite creates no extra users and keeps using
`e2e/.auth/state.json` unchanged. Parallel workers receive different usernames and contexts. Multi-user
specs must mutate only per-user resources (personal shelves, hidden/read state, annotations) or use an
already-dedicated book lane and restore it; creating a second account does not make shared catalog writes
safe while the suite is `fullyParallel` with two CI workers.
