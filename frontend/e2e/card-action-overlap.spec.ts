/*
 * #1112 — the Edit pencil overlapped the "Read now" label on a book card.
 *
 * Reported by @Andrew-H2O after the vertical-alignment fix on #863, with a
 * 335px-wide screenshot: the label read "Read no…" because the pencil sat on
 * top of its tail. At the time this shipped, the coarse-pointer block made both
 * controls permanently visible. The operator reversed that ruling on
 * 2026-08-29; coarse pointers no longer have this side-by-side row, while
 * fine pointers retain it. This probe therefore runs only where the overlap
 * contract exists and still focuses each pencil before measuring.
 *
 * Measured on a real library before the fix: 52px of the label ran under the
 * button at 360px and at 768px. After: 0px.
 *
 * Geometry rather than a screenshot, because the failure is positional and a
 * pixel diff would also fire on every unrelated restyle.

// by the e2e gate the first time it ran (#953), which is the gate earning its
// keep on its first outing.
