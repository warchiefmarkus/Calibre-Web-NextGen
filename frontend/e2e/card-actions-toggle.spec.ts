/*
 * #1054 — "Can we please have the option of hiding the 'Read Now' and the edit
 * button in Library view. It makes the main page look messy." (@Glennza1962)
 *
 * The controls were already hover-revealed on a mouse (#1185), but a user who
 * reads on an ereader never wants them, and on a touchscreen they are pinned
 * visible by the coarse-pointer block. So: a real preference in the catalog's
 * View settings, persisted per browser.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is that switching it off REMOVES the controls
 * rather than hiding them. The hover-reveal uses `opacity: 0`, which leaves a
 * focusable link in the tab order — a keyboard user who turned these off would
 * otherwise tab through two invisible controls on every card in the grid.
