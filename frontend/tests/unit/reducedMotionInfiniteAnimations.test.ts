/*
 * Every infinite animation in the SPA must have a reduced-motion off-switch.
 *
 * MEASURED DEFECT (F-7d206e, counted from the files 2026-08-18): eight CSS
 * modules carried an `animation: … infinite` rule. Four switched it off under
 * `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` and three did not -- including
 * `components/Spinner.module.css` `.ring`, the shared <Spinner>/<SpinnerCentered>
 * used more widely than any other loading indicator in the app. So the fork was
 * inconsistent with itself in both directions, and a user who asks their OS to
 * reduce motion got a still spinner on some screens and a spinning one on
 * others, on the same page load.
 *
 * The house rule, already followed by the four that were correct, is
 * `animation: none` under the reduce query. This suite pins that rule to the
 * POPULATION rather than to today's file list: it derives the classes carrying
 * an infinite animation by scanning the modules, and fails if any one of them
 * lacks an off-switch. A spinner added later in the same shape as today's
 * fails here without anyone remembering this finding existed.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, stated plainly so the green is not read as more than
 * it is. These are text scanners, not a CSS parser, and each gap below was
 * probed against the real scanner rather than reasoned about:
 *   - Longhand form. `animation-name` + `animation-iteration-count: infinite`
 *     is invisible to the infinite scanner. No module uses longhand today, so
 *     this is a future hole, not a present miss.
 *   - Compound or mixed selector groups. `.a, .b:hover { animation: … infinite }`
 *     and `.parent .spinner { … }` are skipped: the selector regex accepts only
 *     plain `.class` lists. Every animated rule in the codebase today is a plain
 *     class, which is why the population below is still complete.
 *   - Conditional off-switches. A rule nested inside `@supports` or a second
 *     `@media` INSIDE the reduce block counts as an off-switch even when its
 *     condition is false, and `@media not all and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
 *     counts even though it never applies. Deciding those needs query
 *     evaluation, not text matching.
 * A stricter gate would need a real CSS parser, which the frontend deliberately
 * does not ship (no test framework either — see test_frontend_unit_suites_run.py).
 * The trade is recorded here so the next person can make it deliberately.
 *
 * Deliberately a static CSS analysis, not a browser test. `prefers-reduced-motion`
 * is an OS-level setting; asserting on the stylesheet is the cheap, deterministic
 * form of the same question, and it is the form that keeps working when the
 * component is refactored.
