# Set ownership of every directory CWA needs to write to, walking each once.
#
# Called by the cwa-init s6 unit at every container start.
#
# The list is a fixed floor (/config, plus the narrow set of app-tree dirs the
# runtime user writes) and whatever dirs.json declares. dirs.json ships
# calibre_library_dir=/calibre-library and
# tmp_conversion_dir=/config/.cwa_conversion_tmp, and the old inline version of
# this logic hardcoded /calibre-library and /config on top of that -- so every
# start chowned the whole library twice and re-walked a subtree of /config that
# /config's own recursive pass had already covered (#874).
#
# The floor is not optional. dirs.json declares neither /config nor the app-tree
# writables, and all are load-bearing:
#
#   * /config holds app.db and user_profiles.json, which cwa-init writes as root
#     *after* the early chown at the top of the unit. This pass is the only thing
#     that hands them to the runtime user; without it, profile-picture uploads
#     fail with EACCES on a fresh install.
#
# The app tree at /app/calibre-web-automated ships from the image owned by the
# build-time abc (uid 911); the linuxserver base then usermods abc to $PUID at
# runtime, which orphans the tree for any install using the documented PUID.
# The whole tree used to be chowned -R here to repair that -- ~1820 entries,
# 2.5-26s of wall time on a fresh container, and on overlayfs every chown copies
# the file up into the writable layer, so it cost disk too (#941). Almost none
# of it needs re-owning: the static tree is world-readable and every directory
# world-traversable (`find ... ! -perm -o+r` and `... -type d ! -perm -o+x` are
# both empty), so Python imports and template reads work regardless of owner.
# Only the dirs the runtime user *writes* under the app tree need ownership.
#
# cps/cache is such a dir; it is created and chowned earlier in the
# cwa-init unit (before first-run app.db creation needs it), so it is not
# repeated here. The rest of the tree (dirs.json, the code) is written only by
# root or never, so orphaned build-time ownership is harmless.
#
# scripts/auto_library.py also rewrites dirs.json in place at runtime, so a crash
# mid-write can leave it unparseable -- which must not be able to silently reduce
# this pass to nothing.
#
# Every path is env-overridable so the logic is testable without a container;
# see tests/unit/test_set_ownership.py.
