"""Who owns the files ``scripts/`` writes, and whether we can set that owner.

The container runs the Flask app as LinuxServer.io's ``abc`` service account,
so scripts that run as root under s6 hand their output back with
``chown -R abc:abc``. Off Docker there is no ``abc``: the process already runs
as whoever owns the install, the files are already correct, and the chown is
both unnecessary and impossible.

``convert_library.py`` and ``kindle_epub_fixer.py`` already knew this — both
carried their own ``pwd.getpwnam(...) / except KeyError: pass`` guard with the
comment "skip if user doesn't exist, e.g. in CI environments". ``auto_library.py``
and ``ingest_processor.py`` did not, so a source install got a
``CalledProcessError`` traceback printed as an error on first run (#1462
follow-up, reported by @Thovi98 packaging for YunoHost):

.. code-block:: text

    chown: invalid user: 'abc:abc'
    [cwa-auto-library] An error occurred while attempting to recursively set
    ownership of /config to abc:abc. See the following error:
    Command '['chown', '-R', 'abc:abc', '/config']' returned non-zero exit status 1.

Nothing was actually wrong, but the operator cannot tell that from the output.
This module is the single place that answers "is there a service account to
chown to?", so the four scripts stop each having an opinion.

``CWA_SERVICE_USER`` / ``CWA_SERVICE_GROUP`` override the account for packagers
who run under a different one. An account that does not exist is not an error —
it is the normal source-install case, and the chown is skipped.

Deliberately dependency-free, like :mod:`app_paths`: these run before the Flask
stack is usable.
