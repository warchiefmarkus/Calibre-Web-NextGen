"""Single source of truth for the paths ``scripts/`` needs (#1462).

The container installs the app under ``/app``, and for a long time every script
simply wrote that install path out as a literal. That works in Docker and
nowhere else: @Thovi98's YunoHost package installs to
``/var/www/calibreweb-nextgen/build`` and died on the first script it ran,
looking for a seed database that was sitting in the checkout the whole time.

Nothing here is a new convention. ``CWA_APP_ROOT`` was already honoured by
``set_ownership.sh``, ``CALIBRE_DBPATH`` by ``cover_enforcer.py`` and
``ingest_processor.py``, ``CWA_DIRS_JSON`` by ``library_paths.py``. They were
just applied in four places out of thirty. This module makes them the only way
``scripts/`` resolves a path, so a checkout works wherever it is unpacked.

Resolution order, for every knob:

===================  ====================================  =========================
What                 Environment override                  Default
===================  ====================================  =========================
app root             ``CWA_APP_ROOT``                       parent of this file's dir
config dir           ``CALIBRE_DBPATH``                     same as ``cps`` (app root)
``dirs.json``        ``CWA_DIRS_JSON``                      ``<app root>/dirs.json``
``app.db``           ``CWA_APP_DB_PATH``, ``CALIBRE_DBPATH`` ``<config dir>/app.db``
===================  ====================================  =========================

Every default here has to match what ``cps`` resolves to, because the two
halves of the install read and write the same files. Where they disagree, the
disagreement is invisible in Docker — the image sets the environment variables
explicitly — and silent everywhere else: scripts seed a database the app never
opens. Both known cases were fixed together in the #1462 follow-up.

Deliberately dependency-free and free of any ``cps`` import: ``auto_library.py``
runs before the Flask stack is usable, and ``cover_enforcer.py`` has to survive
an environment where importing ``cps`` fails outright.

**These four variables are trusted configuration, not user input.** They are read
from the launch environment — the Dockerfile, the s6 service definitions, or a
packager's systemd unit — and they were already trusted that way before this
module existed. Centralising them does widen what one of them reaches:
``CWA_APP_ROOT`` now selects the ``sys.path`` entry used for ``cps`` imports
across every script rather than a couple of them, so whoever can set it can
choose which ``cps`` package is imported. That is the same privilege the
launch environment already had (it picks the interpreter and the code), but do
not plumb any of these through from a request, a config page, or anything a
library user can influence.

The ``/config`` default is kept exactly as scripts/ already had it. The
container sets ``CALIBRE_DBPATH=/config`` as a Docker ``ENV`` (the #1162 fix),
so that default never fires there — and de-hardcoding the *app* root must not
quietly relocate anybody's *databases*.

    what ``ingest_processor.get_app_db_path()`` has always accepted.

    It used to be the literal ``/config`` instead, which is right in the image

    the Dockerfile sets ``CALIBRE_DBPATH=/config`` explicitly (the #1162 fix),

    into a newly-created ``/config`` at the filesystem root while the app read
    ``<app root>/app.db`` and found nothing. @Thovi98 hit exactly this while
    packaging for YunoHost — "``Created config directory /config``: indeed, but
    it has been created at /config as absolute path" — and the seeding silently
    went to a database the app never opens.
