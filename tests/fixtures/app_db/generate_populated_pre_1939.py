"""Rebuild the frozen populated app.db used by the migration boot gate.

This is a provenance tool, not part of the test run.  The fixture is created
from the product's current SQLAlchemy models, populated through those models,
and then downgraded with the shipped ``rollback_user_library_schema`` hook.
The resulting database is intentionally frozen: regenerating it after a new
migration lands would add that migration's schema to the starting point and
erase the coverage the fixture exists to provide.

Run this only when deliberately advancing the oldest supported upgrade
boundary, then review the accompanying gate and its documented coverage.
