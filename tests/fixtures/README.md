# Test Fixtures for Calibre-Web Automated

This directory contains test data used by the CWA test suite.

## Sample Books

All sample books in `sample_books/` are in the **public domain** and sourced from:

### Project Gutenberg
- **License**: Public domain (copyright expired in the United States)
- **URL**: https://www.gutenberg.org/
- **Terms**: These works are free to use, modify, and distribute

Books included from Project Gutenberg:
- "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll (1865) - EPUB, MOBI, TXT
- "Metamorphosis" by Franz Kafka (1915) - EPUB, TXT
- "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens (1843) - EPUB, TXT
- "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle (1892) - EPUB
- "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen (1813) - EPUB (24MB, includes images)

### Standard Ebooks
- **License**: Public domain + CC0 (no copyright)
- **URL**: https://standardebooks.org/
- **Quality**: High-quality formatting and metadata

### Synthetic Test Files
Files prefixed with `test_` are programmatically generated minimal files for testing:
- `test_minimal_valid.epub` - Smallest valid EPUB (for fast tests)
- `test_corrupted.epub` - Invalid file structure (for error handling)
- `test_empty.epub` - Zero-byte file (edge case)
- `test_huge_filename_*.epub` - Filename length limit testing
- `test_special_chars !@#$.epub` - Path handling with ASCII special characters
- `test_international_äöüß_éèêë_áéíóú_ñ_åøæ_książka.epub` - Unicode/international characters (German, French, Spanish, Polish, Nordic)

## Usage

### Download Sample Books
```bash
cd tests/fixtures
python download_gutenberg.py
```

This will download ~5-10 small public domain books in multiple formats (EPUB, MOBI, HTML, TXT).

### Generate Synthetic Test Files
```bash
cd tests/fixtures
python generate_synthetic.py
```

This creates minimal valid and intentionally corrupted files for edge case testing.

## KOReader positions (`koreader_xpointer/`)

Ground truth for the CFI <-> KOReader XPointer converter (`cps/services/koreader_xpointer.py`, #324),
taken from KOReader itself rather than written by hand:

- `metamorphosis-221.epub`, `alice-222.epub` - the Project Gutenberg EPUBs of *Metamorphosis* and
  *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* (public domain), exactly as a CWNG library served them.
- `<book>.pages.json` - the XPointer KOReader 2026.07.1 recorded at the top of every page of each book
  on a Kindle, with the text that page starts with, read through KOReader's HTTP inspector plugin.
- `probe.epub` - a small synthetic book built by `engine/make_probe.py` to hit each crengine
  text-node rule (whitespace-only nodes, inline vs block siblings, hidden elements, entities).
- `head-voids.epub` - a synthetic book built by `engine/make_head_voids.py`: `.html` chapters whose `<head>`
  leaves `<meta>`/`<link>` open, their self-closed twin, and three chapters that must stay refused (an open
  void in the body, a head still malformed once closed, the open head in an `.xhtml` member). Text from
  *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* (public domain).
- `engine-words.json` - word ranges reported by KOReader's own crengine for the four books above, from
  `engine/probe.lua` run inside the KOReader linux-arm64 release by `engine/run-probe.sh` (`head-voids`: every
  word, KOReader v2026.07.1, 2026-09-25).
- `alice-pg11.epub` - Project Gutenberg #11 (*Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*, public domain), today's
  ebookmaker build (`pg11.epub.noimages`, fetched 2026-09-25): every `.html` chapter carries `<a id="…"/>` or
  `<div/>`, which the browser's HTML parser reads as OPEN tags while crengine keeps them empty.
- `alice-pg11.browser.json` - for every 50th word crengine reports in that book (KOReader v2026.07.1, through
  `engine/run-probe.sh … words`), the CFI real epub.js 0.3.93 gave the same word in Chromium. Rebuild: run the
  probe, then `engine/browser_requests.py <epub> <words.json> <n>` (from the repo root) and
  `FRONTEND_DIR=<frontend> node engine/browser_cfis.mjs <epub> <requests.json>`; keep rows whose `text`
  equals crengine's word (all did).
- `alice-pg11.kepub.epub` - what CWNG serves a Kobo for `alice-pg11.epub`: `kepubify` v4.0.4 (the release the
  Dockerfile pins), then `normalize_kepub_package(path, split_chapters=True)`, which splits the Gutenberg chapter
  files into pieces with new names.
- `alice-pg11.kobo-spans.json` - every 3rd Kobo span of that KEPUB where crengine itself reports a word starting
  at the XPointer `kepub_alignment` gives the span, with that word (`engine/kobo_spans.py`, from the full
  `run-probe.sh … words` output for `alice-pg11.epub`).
- `rig-web-rows.json`, `rig-engine-check.json` - two highlights as stored by a test server (one made on
  the Kindle, one in the web reader) and crengine's text for each.

## File Size Considerations

- Total fixture size: ~5-10 MB
- Individual books: 200KB - 1MB each
- Synthetic files: <50KB each
- **These files ARE committed to the repository** for reproducible tests
