# Real application integration fixture (P0.1, extended by P1.kobo)

Status: fixture and lifecycle exercised; Docker parity is claimed for the
backend wire only, and runs only where a matching image exists. The fixture
now boots in two shapes — with the shipped defaults, and with Kobo sync on so
the conditional Kobo blueprints exist (section 5).

1. **Fixture — OBSERVED.** `conftest.py:10` supplies a real Flask app from
   `create_app(cps.config, services)` followed by `register_blueprints`.
   Storage uses the shipped empty Calibre schema and production settings models.
   No updater, scheduler, CSRF, middleware, service, or blueprint is stubbed.
   Environment paths and Python's cached temporary directory are isolated.
   The real startup cleanup task therefore operates on disposable scratch.
   `cases.py:73` checks configured storage, middleware, CSRF, error handlers,
   and the actual login response. The registration negative control observes
   `/login` changing from 404 without registration to 200 with registration;
   tokenless POST remains 400. The fixture does not disable CSRF to make it pass.

   The outer integration test starts a fresh pytest interpreter to avoid the
   existing unit collection's process-global stubs. Inside it, tests receive
   the actual app, not an HTTP proxy or serialized substitute. Add further
   real-app cases to `cases.py`, requesting `real_app` and using
   `real_app.test_client()`; cases that need the Kobo blueprints request
   `kobo_real_app` instead and live in their own module (section 5), because
   `cps` refuses a second boot in one interpreter. The `cases.py` child has
   five tests; its outer process has two tests. Neither case module matches
   automatic discovery: each is named explicitly by its outer module.

2. **Blueprint requests — OBSERVED; parity — UNVERIFIED.** `cases.py:88`
   derives probes from `app.blueprints` and `app.url_map`. It selects a
   reachable rule, accounting for rules shadowed by earlier blueprints.
   Observed: 34 registered blueprints, 33 HTTP probes — with the shipped defaults. Four more (`kobo`, `kobo_auth`, `readingservices_api_v3`, `readingservices_userstorage`) register only when `kobo_available` holds (`cps/main.py:124`), so they are outside *this* boot's reach; `blueprints.json` lists them so the gap is visible rather than silent, and the second boot in section 5 reaches them. `jinjia` has no routes;
   its real template filter is exercised instead. An unknown routeless
   blueprint fails explicitly. OAuth probes use credential-free callbacks,
   without following provider redirects. These are anonymous smoke requests,
   not authenticated feature coverage.

   The Docker comparator checks status, MIME type, Location, and JSON body
   against those same requests. It requires a usable daemon and matching
   actual backend source in `CWA_TEST_IMAGE`. It owns a unique disposable
   container, anonymous volumes, and an ephemeral port. It does not use the
   shared lane container name, pull images, or write a Compose override.
   An explicitly selected stale image fails; a stale default dev image skips.

   Against the default `crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated:dev` image an
   actual comparison failed: Docker's `/login/github/authorized` returned
   Location `/login/github`; the fixture returned `/login?local=1`. That image
   is UPSTREAM, not this fork, so the difference is a fork divergence and not a
   product bug — the `revision` label on it (`6eefa9815a96`) belongs to the
   LinuxServer base image and resolves to nothing in this history; an earlier
   draft of this file read it as a CWNG commit. The source checksum
   precondition rejects that mismatched comparison, which is the precondition
   doing real work rather than papering over a divergence.

   OBSERVED by the judge, driving the comparison directly with the
   source-checksum precondition BYPASSED, against a fork-built image 28 of 266
   in-scope files drifted from this checkout: **0 mismatching rows of 31**, ready
   in 4.6 s. That was the first time the comparison ran to completion at all,
   but with the precondition bypassed.

   **The comparison as shipped has since run in CI and passed.** OBSERVED, run
   34014021079 on the Integration Tests (Docker) lane: `test_real_app.py`
   contributes no SKIPPED line and both cases report PASSED, so the digest
   precondition was SATISFIED by the lane's own freshly built image and the
   comparison genuinely executed. That closes the one link earlier evidence
   established only by composition — that an image built from a checkout
   digests identically to it. What a green there does not prove is depth: 26 of
   the 33 probe rows are `302 -> /login?next=...`, so it mostly says anonymous
   requests redirect to login on both sides.

   **Scope, and why it is drawn here.** Two things the comparison must not
   report as parity failures, because neither is the application:

   *The compiled SPA bundle.* `cps/static/app/` is gitignored, and the
   Integration Tests lane builds the image from the checkout without building it
   first (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`, "Build Docker image" then "Run Docker
   integration tests"), so a CI checkout has no bundle while the image it built
   does. OBSERVED in a fresh checkout: `/app/` answers 404, one probe row,
   blueprint `spa`. Asserting the bundle exists would have failed that lane on
   every run.

   *A route that reads the client's source address.* Werkzeug's test client
   presents `REMOTE_ADDR` 127.0.0.1; a request through a container's published
   port arrives from the bridge gateway. OBSERVED, exactly one route differs for
   this reason: `/cwa-internal/duplicate-scan-status` returns 200 to loopback and
   500 to anyone else (`cps/cwa_functions.py:478-493` aborts 403 and the bare
   `except Exception` re-emits it as a 500 — a product defect recorded separately,
   not fixed here). `cases.py` asks every route directly, from a documentation
   -range address (RFC 5737), so this exclusion set is MEASURED on each run rather
   than maintained by hand: a route that stops caring rejoins the comparison, and
   one that starts caring leaves it, without anyone editing a list.

   `_backend_parity_rows` returns the rows it compares and, for each row it does
   not, the reason. A bundle-served exclusion must belong to a blueprint the
   module claims; every other exclusion must carry the measured flag. That
   decision is pinned by `tests/unit/test_real_app_parity_partition.py` (9 cases,
   each seen red against a mutant of the rule).

   **What is still unverified, plainly.** The comparison has never been observed
   green. It skips on a developer machine without a matching image. The one
   environment that builds a matching image is the Integration Tests lane, and
   there `CWA_TEST_IMAGE` is set (`tests.yml:369`), which turns the digest
   mismatch from a skip into a hard failure — so that lane, not a developer, is
   where this leg first proves or disproves itself. A change under
   `tests/integration/` sets `build: true` in `scripts/ci_path_classification.py`,
   which makes that lane gating rather than advisory. The remaining risk is not
   provisioning: it is that a matching image may expose divergences this
   28-file-drifted comparison could not, since the digest covers first-party
   source only and not the dependency graph, the Python version, or runtime
   config.

   Separately, exploratory `/login/generic` returned 500 with default settings;
   no product change or claim of Docker equivalence was made for that route.

3. **Lifecycle — OBSERVED.** `cases.py:7` executes the second factory call
   before other cases create additional apps. Profile instrumentation observes
   the real factory body owning the real native RLock. Foreign-thread probes
   observe refusal while held and successful acquisition after return.
   The updater and scheduler retain their original live thread objects.
   `test_native_lock_stalls_greenlets` measures contention under unpatched
   gevent without invoking the factory from a request or a foreign thread.
   Real output from the three final repetitions:

   ```text
   LIFECYCLE before: updater_alive=False scheduler_exists=False initialized=False
   LIFECYCLE second: updater_alive=True updater_count=1 scheduler_running=True scheduler_thread_count=1 same_runtime=True factory_lock_owned=True foreign_acquire_held=False foreign_acquire_after=True
   LOCK native unpatched: lock_wait -> os_release -> lock_acquired -> greenlet_ran
   LIFECYCLE teardown: updater_alive=False scheduler_running=False
   ```

   This characterizes a blocking constraint; it does not make concurrent or
   request-time factory calls safe. No product lock change was attempted.

4. **Lane and repetitions — OBSERVED locally, not a Linux CI execution.**
   Existing `integration-tests` runs `pytest tests/docker/ tests/integration/`.
   The new outer module declares only `integration`. No workflow edit is
   needed for discovery. Parity is not finished by provisioning: see the
   scope note above for what actually stands in the way. No CI/workflow file
   was edited.

   Commands below abbreviate the mandated absolute interpreter as `$PY`;
   every recorded run used Python 3.12.7 / pytest 9.0.3 from that interpreter.

   ```text
   $PY -m pytest tests/integration/test_real_app.py -m 'smoke or unit' --collect-only -q
   collected 2 items / 2 deselected / 0 selected

   $PY -m pytest -m 'smoke or unit' --collect-only -q
   8813/8936 tests collected (123 deselected) in 6.32s

   $PY -m pytest tests/integration/test_real_app.py tests/unit/test_application_factory.py -q -s -rs --tb=short
   Run 1: child 5 passed in 3.09s; outer 18 passed, 1 skipped in 7.36s
   Run 2: child 5 passed in 3.22s; outer 18 passed, 1 skipped in 7.58s
   Run 3: child 5 passed in 6.02s; outer 18 passed, 1 skipped in 12.48s
   ```

   The first two final skips were the stale Docker image; the third was an
   unavailable daemon. Earlier exploratory failures were not counted as
   successful repetitions. Full fast-lane execution on Linux is unverified.

5. **Kobo authority and containment — OBSERVED (P1.kobo).** Three properties
   of the owned-annotation route had never been observed on the running
   application: every prior test of them drives `handle_annotations.__wrapped__`
   directly, with ownership monkeypatched, the device id assigned by hand and an
   in-memory session. Six earlier attempts to observe them on the application
   reported NOT_RUN or FAIL with the product behaving correctly, and the reason
   is recorded here so it is not rediscovered a seventh time: **the shipped
   fixture cannot reach any of them, because with `config_kobo_sync` false
   `cps/main.py:130` never registers `readingservices_api_v3`, so
   `/api/v3/content/<id>/annotations` answers 404 whatever the databases hold.**
   `conftest.py:103`'s `kobo_real_app` writes that switch before the factory
   runs, then asserts the blueprint *and* the URL rule in both directions, so a
   boot that silently lost the surface fails at the fixture instead of looking,
   from inside a case, like a product that refused to answer.

   `kobo_authority_cases.py` drives an authenticated Kobo GET, against a book
   whose `KoboAnnotationBookState` is `ever_authoritative`, into each of the
   three ETag-emitting sticky exits of `_owned_annotation_get_response`. Each
   case reads the gate *before* asserting on the response, and each exit is
   identified by behaviour rather than by a line number:

   | Exit | How it is forced | How it is told apart | ETag observed |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `answered_from_snapshot` (`readingservices.py:849`) | a GET with no device id, so `prepare_authoritative_device_get` matches no `Device` row and answers `STICKY_GET_SNAPSHOT` | the body is the stored snapshot and omits a highlight added after it; `authority_revision` and `last_served_body_sha256` do not move | `cwng_revision`, equal to the stored `last_served_etag` |
   | `answered_locally` (`readingservices.py:905`) | a GET with the registered device id plus one accepted `routing_only` seed capture | the body carries the live row and the render is committed: `etag_kind`, `current_etag`, `last_served_*` all advance | `cwng_revision`, freshly built by `_commit_complete_render` |
   | sticky exception fallback (`readingservices.py:948`) | a book with no durable snapshot, so the control request 503s, then the pre-serve proof raises | a 200 is only reachable through the route's `except`; the collected log record carries that exact exception | `cwng_revision`, rebuilt live |

   All three produced the **durable** `cwng_revision` form. The transient form
   (`kobo_annotation_authority.py:326`) was NOT exercised: it needs
   `_book_state` to fail or to reject the content id, which an owned book with
   a healthy app.db does not do.

   `kobo_containment_cases.py` observes the second property at the trigger
   boundary rather than by calling the predicate. `handle_check_for_changes`
   is driven twice with the same id: with the library readable the id is
   provably not ours and is forwarded (1 proxy call, and it comes back in the
   device's change list); with `metadata.db` emptied the same id resolves to
   `OWNERSHIP_UNKNOWN` and is suppressed (0 proxy calls, `[]` returned). That
   is `_check_for_changes_ownership_is_filtered` (`readingservices.py:515`)
   treating UNKNOWN as owned so a database outage cannot let Nickel's
   replacement-set GET delete the reader's only copy of a highlight. That
   module runs in its own interpreter because the outage is process-wide and
   the calibre engine does not come back from it cleanly.

   The third property is reported as a measurement: over **12** identical
   authenticated GETs for one book in one session, `resolve_entitlement_ownership`
   returned the same answer every time — distinct set `[('owned', <book id>)]`,
   all twelve responses 200, zero proxy calls.

   **What the pre-existing suite could and could not see — MEASURED.** Each
   defect below was planted on `origin/main` and the 436 pre-existing tests that
   reference `cps/readingservices.py` or
   `cps/services/kobo_annotation_authority.py` were re-run (clean baseline: all
   green). Dropping the ETag on the **`answered_locally`** exit is caught — 5
   failures, split across **two** files that reach that same exit on the
   *pre-authority* path: two in `test_1923_owned_annotations_local_authority.py`
   (`test_owned_get_is_full_200_raw_exact_if_none_match_ignored_and_etag_moves`,
   `test_owned_get_survives_normalized_book_state_insert_integrity_error`) and
   three in `test_1942_seed_pipeline.py`
   (`test_local_get_ignores_if_none_match_and_never_returns_304`,
   `test_prior_cwng_etag_on_authoritative_book_returns_current_local_set_200_never_proxy`,
   `test_dual_live_query_failure_serves_exact_last_complete_snapshot`). The node
   ids come from a `-rf` run; an earlier revision of this paragraph attributed
   all five to `test_1923` alone, which was inferred from a failure *count*
   rather than read from a FAILED list, and was wrong. Anyone minimising this
   suite must treat all five as guards on that exit. Dropping it on the
   **`answered_from_snapshot`** exit is not: **435 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed**.
   Nothing in the old suite names `prepare_authoritative_device_get` or
   `STICKY_GET_SNAPSHOT`, and nothing constructs an ever-authoritative book whose
   device proof is missing. So the new value here is uneven and worth stating
   plainly: for `answered_locally` it is the *real application* (a real login
   session, the auth decorator, device registration from request headers,
   metadata.db ownership, the full response pipeline) rather than a new branch;
   for `answered_from_snapshot` and the exception fallback it is the branch
   itself.

   `test_real_app_kobo.py` pins the expected pass count per module. A case
   that stops being collected, or skips, is a failure there — the specific way
   the earlier attempts reported a result without observing anything.

Changed-file reconciliation against `origin/main`:

- `tests/integration/real_app/conftest.py`: real-app fixture and teardown, in
  two boots (shipped defaults, and Kobo sync on) sharing one boot recipe.
- `tests/integration/real_app/cases.py`: five isolated runtime cases.
- `tests/integration/real_app/kobo_fixture.py`: synthetic seeding helpers for
  the Kobo cases, and the CWNG ETag shape.
- `tests/integration/real_app/kobo_authority_cases.py`: the three sticky ETag
  exits and the ownership-determinism measurement.
- `tests/integration/real_app/kobo_containment_cases.py`: the check-for-changes
  containment of `OWNERSHIP_UNKNOWN`, in its own interpreter.
- `tests/integration/test_real_app_kobo.py`: lane entry and per-module
  expected pass counts for the two Kobo case modules.
- `tests/integration/real_app/blueprints.json`: the pinned blueprint list, split
  into unconditional and conditional. The only artifact here that does not come
  from the app itself, and the only thing that can notice a blueprint vanishing.
- `tests/integration/test_real_app.py`: lane entry, isolation, Docker comparison.
- `tests/unit/test_real_app_parity_partition.py`: the parity exclusion rule,
  which the Docker comparison would otherwise never exercise on a machine
  without a matching image.
- `tests/integration/real_app/README.md`: usage, evidence, outstanding parity.
