"""Explicitly invoked in isolation by tests/integration/test_real_app_kobo.py.

Three properties of the owned-annotation GET are asserted by the code and have
never been observed on the route: which of ``_owned_annotation_get_response``'s
sticky exits emits an ``ETag``, and what that header actually looks like. All
three exits live behind ``ever_authoritative``, which the shipped fixture never
reaches, so each case below first drives the application into the sticky state
and proves it is there before asserting anything about the response.
