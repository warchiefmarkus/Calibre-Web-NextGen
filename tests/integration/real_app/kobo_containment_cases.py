"""Explicitly invoked in isolation by tests/integration/test_real_app_kobo.py.

This module runs in its own interpreter because it takes the library database
away mid-session, and the calibre engine does not come back cleanly from that
inside one process. Isolating the outage is also the honest shape: a broken
metadata.db is a process-wide fault, and letting it leak into other cases would
make their results say something other than what they claim.

    Nickel answers a "this content changed" reply with a replacement-set

    risks deleting the reader's only copy of a highlight. Suppressing the id
    only costs a delayed cloud sync.

    metadata.db has been emptied so the real ownership query raises and
    ``resolve_entitlement_ownership`` answers OWNERSHIP_UNKNOWN. The predicate
    is never called directly; only the trigger boundary is observed.
    Breaks if: UNKNOWN stops being contained -- the id would be forwarded to
    Kobo and returned to the device exactly as in the healthy control.
