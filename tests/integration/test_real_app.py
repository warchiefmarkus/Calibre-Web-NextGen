    * The Vite bundle under ``cps/static/app/``, which is gitignored and which no

    * A route whose answer depends on the client's source address. Werkzeug's
      test client presents ``REMOTE_ADDR`` 127.0.0.1; a request through a
      container's published port arrives from the bridge gateway. ``cases.py``
      asks each route directly whether it answers a stranger differently, so this
