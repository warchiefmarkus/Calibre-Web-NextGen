"""Source pins for #578 — the new UI didn't keep the library scroll position when
going Back from a book. The Catalog now stashes its loaded pages + filters +
scrollY in an in-memory cache (lib/scrollCache) keyed by route and rehydrates
them on remount, restoring the scroll offset. Behavioural coverage is the live
Playwright scroll test; these guard the wiring from silent removal.
