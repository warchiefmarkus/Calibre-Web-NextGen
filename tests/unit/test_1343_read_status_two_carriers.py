"""#1343 — read state must not live in two carriers that can disagree.

#1340 stopped the web reader from un-finishing a book the user marked Read, by
refusing to share a position when ``ub.ReadBook.read_status`` is FINISHED. On a
default install that is right. On a ``config_read_column`` install it was wrong
in *both* directions, because ``helper.edit_book_read_status``'s custom-column
branch wrote only the Calibre column and never mirrored the state into
``ub.ReadBook`` — while ``update_book_read_status`` wrote ``ub.ReadBook``
unconditionally. The two carriers drifted, and each direction produced a bug:

  1. **Permanent silent wedge** (a regression #1340 introduced). Finish a book
     in the browser -> ``ReadBook.read_status`` = FINISHED. Click "mark unread"
     to re-read it -> the custom branch clears the Calibre column, and
     ``reset_reading_position`` folds only IN_PROGRESS back to UNREAD, so
     ``ReadBook`` stays FINISHED. Every later web-reader save is refused,
     forever, with no web-UI path to clear it. Before #1340 the write went
     through and incidentally healed the stale FINISHED — the guard removed
     that silent repair without adding one.

  2. **The original bug survived** for the same users. "Mark read" wrote only
     the Calibre column, so no FINISHED row existed and the guard never fired:
     opening the book still counted a reading session and pushed
     ``StatusInfo: "Reading"`` to the Kobo.

  3. **A finished book froze below 100%.** ``update_book_read_status`` finishes
     at >= 99%, so the save that crossed the line marked the book FINISHED and
     the guard then blocked the *next* one — the stored percentage stuck at
     e.g. 99.2 and the device was told 99% indefinitely.

Fixed by closing the root cause (the custom branch mirrors read state into
``ub.ReadBook`` in both directions, restoring the escape hatch and giving the
subsystem one source of truth) and by narrowing the guard to refuse only writes
that would actually DOWNGRADE a finished book, rather than every write.

The percentage->status thresholds now have a single implementation
(``kosync.read_status_for_percentage``) that both the writer and the guard call,
so the two cannot drift into a third disagreement.
