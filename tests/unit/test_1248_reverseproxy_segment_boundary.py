"""#1248 — ReverseProxied must strip the mount prefix only on a path-segment
boundary.

Reported by @chloeroform on v4.1.25: behind a reverse proxy with
`PROXY_SCRIPT_NAME=/cwa`, every "More server configuration" link on the admin
page 404s — `/cwa-settings`, `/cwa-settings#duplicate-detection`,
`/cwa-stats-show` — while the neighbouring `/admin/*` links on the same page
work fine.

Root cause. The middleware stripped the prefix on a bare `str.startswith()`
match:

    if path_info.startswith(script_name):
        environ['PATH_INFO'] = path_info[len(script_name):]

That predicate is true for any path that merely *shares the prefix's
characters*, not just for genuine child paths. This repo has 37 routes whose
paths begin `/cwa-` (the entire `cps/cwa_functions.py` surface), so with a
`/cwa` mount:

    PATH_INFO=/cwa-settings  →  '-settings'   →  404
    PATH_INFO=/admin/config  →  untouched     →  200

which is exactly the asymmetry the reporter saw. The `/admin/*` links working
is the diagnostic wedge, not a coincidence.

Why the reporter's PATH_INFO arrives already stripped: the README's documented
nginx recipe uses `proxy_pass http://…:8083/;` (trailing slash), which strips
`/cwa` at the proxy, plus `PROXY_SCRIPT_NAME=/cwa` so `url_for` still emits
prefixed URLs. Both prefix-stripping and non-stripping proxy modes must work,
and a segment-boundary check satisfies both:

  * stripping proxy      → PATH_INFO=/cwa-settings      → no boundary → keep
  * non-stripping proxy  → PATH_INFO=/cwa/cwa-settings  → boundary    → strip

The SPA's own idempotency guard already got this boundary right
(`frontend/src/lib/api.ts::resourceUrl`, `u === BASE_PREFIX ||
u.startsWith(BASE_PREFIX + '/')`, pinned by
`tests/unit/test_571_reverse_proxy_prefix.py`). The WSGI middleware did not.
These tests close that asymmetry.

Also pinned here: PEP 3333 normalisation. `SCRIPT_NAME` must not end in `/`
and a non-empty `PATH_INFO` must start with `/`. Operators routinely write
`PROXY_SCRIPT_NAME=/cwa/`, which previously produced `SCRIPT_NAME='/cwa/'` and
`PATH_INFO='books'` — a second, independent 404 class. `cps/spa.py` already
defends itself with `request.script_root.rstrip('/')`; the middleware is the
right place to normalise once.
