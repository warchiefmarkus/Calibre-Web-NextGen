"""Regression tests for fork #1277 — the classic admin Version Information
table reports the kepubify that is actually running.

Credit: @chloeroform (#1284) for retiring the ``/app/KEPUBIFY_RELEASE`` stamp.

This is the kepubify twin of #1274, and it inherits every trap that one
documented: the probe returns a banner *or* a translated ``LazyString``
diagnostic, it forks a subprocess on a request handler, and the path behind it
is a mutable admin setting. Those are pinned once, in
``test_1274_calibre_version_from_runtime.py``, against the shared helper both
labels now route through.

What is pinned *here* is what is specific to kepubify, and two of the three
were live defects in the first cut of #1284 that a fully green CI did not see:

* **The banner has no closing delimiter.** Calibre's is fenced —
  ``(calibre 9.11.0)`` — so a lazy ``(.+?)`` terminates on the ``)``. kepubify
  prints ``kepubify v4.0.4`` with nothing after the digits, so the same lazy
  quantifier stops at the first character it can: ``v4.0.4`` renders as
  ``vv4``. Every parametrised case below fails that way on the pre-fix build,
  including the ``-rc1`` suffix that a greedy-but-unanchored pattern truncates.

* **The version token already carries its own ``v``.** Calibre's does not, so
  the shared renderer prepends one. Capturing ``v...`` rather than the digits
  doubles it. The two banners disagree about this, which is exactly the kind of
  detail a copy-pasted regex gets wrong.

* **A NameError here takes the whole admin page down.** The lookup sits after
  the ``try``, deliberately — an undefined name is a bug in *this* module, not
  a failed probe, and must not be laundered into "Unknown". Nothing in the
  suite called the function, so the typo in the first cut reached a green
  ``Test Suite Summary`` (``__KEPUBIFYANNER_RE`` defined,
  ``_KEPUBIFY_BANNER_RE`` referenced). ``test_the_admin_row_is_rendered_from_a_live_probe``
  is the guard: it exercises the real call the admin page makes.
