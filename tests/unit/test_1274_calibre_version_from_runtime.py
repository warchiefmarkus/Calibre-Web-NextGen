"""Regression tests for fork #1274 — the classic admin Version Information
table reports the calibre that is actually running.

Credit: @chloeroform (#1274) for retiring the ``/app/CALIBRE_RELEASE`` stamp.

The stamp recorded what the *build* pinned, so an image whose calibre was
replaced, or an install pointing ``config_converterpath`` somewhere else,
reported a version it was not running. The row now derives from
``converter.get_calibre_version()`` — the same helper the SPA ``/stats`` page
already used.

Three things about that swap are easy to get wrong, and all three are pinned
below because none of them fails loudly:

* **The diagnostics are LazyStrings, not str.** ``get_calibre_version()``
  returns the ``ebook-convert (calibre 9.11.0)`` banner *or* a translated
  ``not installed`` / ``Execution permissions missing``. Running a regex over
  the latter raises ``TypeError``, and a bare ``except`` turns an actionable,
  translated diagnostic into an opaque, untranslated "Unknown".

* **The probe forks a subprocess and blocks on wait().** cps runs gevent
  without ``monkey.patch_all()``, so an uncached probe on a request handler
  stalls every other greenlet — the exact failure mode fixed in #1270. The
  admin table lands here on an ordinary page load, so the result is memoised.

* **The memo key is a mutable admin setting.** ``config_converterpath`` is
  editable in the UI. Caching on the function (rather than on the path) freezes
  the answer for the life of the process, so an admin who corrects a wrong path
  keeps seeing the stale value until the container restarts. Failures must not
  be cached at all, or installing calibre appears to have no effect.
