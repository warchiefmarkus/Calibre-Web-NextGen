"""Regression tests for fork issue #627 — marking a book *unread* must clear the
"Started reading" and "Last synced" dates, not just the percentage.

Reporter @uschi1 confirmed the v4.1.21 "Send to Reader" fix worked, then
reported the residual: *"when I set my test book to 'unread', it doesn't delete
the start date and the last sync date"*.

Root cause: ``helper.reset_reading_position`` nulled only
``KoboBookmark.progress_percent`` / ``content_source_progress_percent``. The
same row's ``created_at`` (rendered as "Started reading") and its
``location_*`` resume point survived the reset. ``last_modified`` (rendered as
"Last synced") carries an ``onupdate`` default, so the very act of nulling the
percentage *bumped* it to the moment of the reset — the user marked a book
unread and watched "Last synced" change to now.

Two independent defects, so two independent fixes, both pinned here:

  * the reset is now a genuine reset — ``created_at``, the ``location_*``
    resume point (which ``kobo.get_current_bookmark_response`` serialises back
    to the device as ``Location``, letting it restore the exact position) and
    the ``KoboStatistics`` counters are cleared;
  * the three display values are resolved as ONE unit by
    ``helper.get_kosync_progress_display`` — with no position, the timestamps
    describe nothing and are reported as ``None``. This is what repairs rows
    that were already half-reset by an older build, without a migration.

``last_modified`` is deliberately NOT cleared: ``reset_reading_position``
depends on its ``onupdate`` bump so the reset propagates to the device as the
newest reading state on the next sync. Pinned below so a future edit can't
"tidy" it away.
