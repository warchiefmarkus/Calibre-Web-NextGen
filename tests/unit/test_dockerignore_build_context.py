"""Contract tests for the Docker build context (``.dockerignore``).

``Dockerfile`` copies the *entire* build context into the runtime image::

    COPY --chown=abc:abc . /app/calibre-web-automated/

so ``.dockerignore`` is the only thing standing between a developer's working
tree and the image. Two failure directions matter, and this module pins both.

**Direction 1 — local-only junk leaking in.** ``.venv``, ``.claude``,
``.coverage`` and ``calibre-web.log`` are all git-ignored, so a clean CI
checkout never has them and published images were never affected. A local
``docker build`` is a different story: measured with a ``FROM scratch`` +
``COPY . /`` probe, excluding just these four took the copied layer from
299,311,528 to 17,832,889 bytes — **281 MB**. This is the same class as the
``.cwa_migrations`` leak documented inline in ``.dockerignore`` (#1162), where a
developer's runtime state got baked into their image and silently changed how
the install behaved.

**Direction 2 — over-excluding something the image needs.** The far more
dangerous direction, and the reason this file exists rather than a bare
"these strings are present" check. ``.dockerignore`` already carries a bare
``app.db`` line. It is safe *only* because Docker patterns are root-anchored:
``app.db`` matches ``./app.db`` and not ``empty_library/app.db``. One well-meaning
edit to ``**/app.db`` would stop shipping the seed database that
``scripts/auto_library.py`` and ``root/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/cwa-init/run``
copy into ``/config`` on a fresh install — every new deployment would come up
without an ``app.db``, and CI would stay green the whole time. So the runtime
allowlist below is asserted as *not excluded*, path by path.

The matcher models Docker's root-anchored, non-recursive semantics. Because a
matcher that silently fails to understand a pattern would turn direction 2 into
a false negative, ``test_no_pattern_forms_beyond_the_matcher`` fails loudly the
moment ``.dockerignore`` grows a form this file does not model (``**``,
negation), rather than quietly passing.
