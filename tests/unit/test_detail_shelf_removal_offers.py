"""The classic book page offers shelf removal only where the server allows it.

``shelf.remove_from_shelf`` refuses a public shelf to a reader without the
"edit public shelves" role, and every private shelf but the reader's own
(``check_shelf_edit_permissions``). The toolbar's "Remove from shelf" menu used
to list every visible shelf holding the book, and to appear whenever any shelf
held it, including another reader's private shelf it could not even list.
