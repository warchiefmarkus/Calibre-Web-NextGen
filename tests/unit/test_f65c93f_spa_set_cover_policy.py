"""F-65c93f: the SPA cover endpoint's two policy gaps.

``cps/api/edit.py::set_cover`` sits between two neighbours in its own module
that both pass ``allow_show_archived=True, allow_show_hidden=True`` (:421,
:439), and next to a cover *picker* that refuses to write while the per-book
cover lock is set (janeczku/calibre-web#2165).  It did neither, so:

1. replacing the cover of your OWN hidden or archived book answered 404, even
   though the edit page for that book opens fine; and
2. a cover you deliberately locked could be replaced from the new UI, while the
   same action through the picker or the classic editor was refused.

Most of what follows is asserted at source level on purpose: the endpoint's
body is a chain of filesystem writes and metadata bookkeeping a unit test
cannot drive without a real library on disk, and what regressed here is which
lookup and which guard the handler chooses.

But a source assertion can only prove a call was *written*, never that its name
*resolves* -- see F-cc5efb.  So the first test below touches the real module
object.  That is not decoration: the first draft of this fix called
``helper.book_cover_is_locked(...)`` in a module that imports names from
``..helper`` and never binds it, which satisfied every source assertion here
and would have raised ``NameError`` on the first request.

The executing coverage for this endpoint lives in ``test_api_v1_edit.py``,
which calls the handler function directly.  There is no integration-lane test
driving this route over HTTP.
