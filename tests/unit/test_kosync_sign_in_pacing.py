"""KOReader sync paces password guesses, not the devices that sync.

KOReader sends its Basic credentials with every request. Wrong ones used to be
checked without limit (and, under LDAP, each cost a directory bind). Now each
client's *new* wrong passwords for an account are counted; after three in a
minute that client is refused 429 before its password is even looked at.

What must never be refused: a device with an app password; the right password
from any client that is not guessing; and the owner of a stale device on the
same home network, whose old password is one wrong password sent again and
again, not a stream of guesses.

Requests go through the real KOReader sync blueprint and a real limiter.
