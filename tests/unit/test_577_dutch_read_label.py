"""Regression tests for #577 — in Dutch the new-UI "open the reader" button read
"Gelezen" (past participle, "has been read") because it reused the msgid "Read",
whose nl translation is the read-*status* label "Gelezen" (correct there). The
button now uses a distinct msgid "Read now" ("Nu lezen"), and the already-read
toggle reuses "Read" (the correct status word) + a separate ✓ instead of the
untranslated "Read ✓".
