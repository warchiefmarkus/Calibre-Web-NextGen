"""Every field the plugin sends must be declared in api.json (#920).

``api.json`` governs the wire through **two independent lua-Spore mechanisms**,
and a field has to satisfy both. Declaring it in one and not the other fails
silently in one direction and loudly in the other. Both have now shipped a bug.

**1. ``payload`` builds the body.** lua-Spore does not send the table the caller
passes; it rebuilds the request body from exactly the keys named in ``payload``
and silently drops everything else (``src/Spore.lua``)::

    if method.payload then
        payload = {}
        for i = 1, #method.payload do
            local v = method.payload[i]
            payload[v] = params[v]
        end
    end

So a field can be set by the client, reviewed in the diff, covered by tests on
both sides, and still never reach the server. That is what happened to #906: it
added ``complete``/``complete_source`` to the push and never touched
``api.json``, so lua-Spore dropped both and the delete-sync it shipped was a
no-op on the wire.

**2. ``required_params`` + ``optional_params`` gate the call.** Before any body
is built, Spore validates the caller's params and *raises* on any name it was
not told to expect (``src/Spore.lua``, ``validate``)::

    local optional_params = method.optional_params or {}
    for param in pairs(params) do
        ...
        assert(found, param .. " is not expected for method " .. caller)
    end

Note the two lists are not related to each other: naming a field in ``payload``
does **not** make it an expected param. #924 declared ``deleted`` /
``delete_source`` in ``payload`` only, so every delete cycle died inside the
plugin with ``deleted is not expected for method push_annotations`` and the push
never left the device — a hard error, where #906's was a silent drop. It escaped
because it was verified server-side over real HTTP, which never exercises
Spore's client-side validation, and because the guard this file added for #906
checked ``payload`` alone.

Neither failure is visible in review — the two files are far apart, and one mode
is silent — so both are pinned here. These tests read the real client source and
the real spec, so they fail when either drifts.
