"""Pin the build-time Calibre /usr/bin symlink stanza (#875).

Calibre's binaries have always shipped inside the image, but the
``/usr/bin`` entry points did not. So ``calibredb --version`` failed on a
cold boot, the ``calibre-binaries-setup`` s6 service concluded Calibre was
"not installed", and it ran ``calibre_postinstall`` on every single start --
about 12s of a ~60s startup, on every restart, forever.

The Dockerfile now creates those links at build time. These tests do two
things:

1. Extract the shipped ``find ... -exec ln`` expression out of the
   Dockerfile and *execute it* against a synthetic ``/opt/calibre`` tree, so
   the assertions are about what the command actually does, not about which
   words appear in the file. A rewrite that keeps the words but breaks the
   behaviour goes red.
2. Pin the two invariants that are easy to lose in a later edit: the
   verification step that fails the build if ``calibredb`` never got linked,
   and the fact that the runtime service is kept as a fallback rather than
   deleted.

The link set deliberately mirrors what ``calibre_postinstall`` itself
creates -- every top-level executable except the installer and
``calibre-complete`` (upstream reaches the completion helper through the
completion scripts, not through PATH). Linking extra files would leave
``/usr/bin/calibre_postinstall`` and a stray marker file on PATH.
