"""Source pins for #573 — the new UI's series view had no way to sort books by
their metadata series position, and the position wasn't shown on the card unless
duplicated in the title.

The fix wires three things, guarded here against silent removal:
  1. Backend: a stateless series_index sort ("seriesasc"/"seriesdesc") in the
     /api/v1/books SORT_MAP, mirroring web.py's get_sort_function.
  2. Frontend: the series view offers "Series order" sort options and defaults to
     ascending series order.
  3. Frontend: the book card renders the series position (showSeriesIndex).

Behavioural coverage is the live Playwright series-view test; these guard the
wiring. (See tests/unit/test_578_scroll_restore.py for the source-pin pattern.)
