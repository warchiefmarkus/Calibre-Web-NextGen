"""Regression tests: the browser was allowed to cache nothing.

Reported symptom — "the site is very slow to scroll", on /app/book/151. It was
not CPU (the SPA attaches no scroll handler on that page and holds 60fps at 6x
throttle); it was network work firing as covers came into view.

Three defects, all pinned here:

1. Every cover was served ``Cache-Control: no-cache``. ``helper`` calls
   ``send_from_directory`` without a ``max_age``, and Flask's
   ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` is ``None`` — which makes ``send_file`` emit
   ``no-cache``. Nothing in ``cps/`` sets that config. So a grid that
   lazy-loads covers issued one revalidation per card, per scroll, for bytes
   already on disk.

2. The SPA detail page asked for the ``og`` cover. ``web.get_cover`` maps
   ``og`` to ``constants.COVER_THUMBNAIL_ORIGINAL``, which is ``0`` — falsy —
   so ``get_book_cover_internal``'s ``if resolution:`` branch never runs and
   the raw library ``cover.jpg`` is served: a ~1250x2000 JPEG for a ~280 CSS-px
   column, when the ``md`` thumbnail (524x840 WebP) already exists.

3. The content-hashed SPA bundle under ``/static/app/assets/`` was revalidated
   on every load for the same reason as (1), even though its filename changes
   whenever its bytes do.

The safety property these tests exist to hold: caching is opt-in **per URL**,
never per duration, and the URL is not taken on trust. Two conditions must both
hold before a cover gets a long lifetime —

  1. the URL's ``c=`` token MATCHES this book's current cover version
     (``cps.cover_version``, microsecond ``Books.last_modified``), and
  2. the bytes being sent are the ones that URL permanently names — never the
     original standing in for a thumbnail that has not been generated yet.

— and everything else keeps ``no-cache``, which is main's behaviour for every
cover URL, so nothing can regress into staleness.
