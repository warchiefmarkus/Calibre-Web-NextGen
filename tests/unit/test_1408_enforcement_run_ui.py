"""Regression pins for the library-wide enforcement run in the web UI (fork #1408).

Reported by @stripeymonkey on #1372: the v4.1.30 notes pointed at "one pass from
Settings via the cover and metadata enforcement", and no such control existed.
CWA Settings only has the ``auto_metadata_enforcement`` toggle, which is the
*on-edit* service. The only library-wide pass was ``cover_enforcer.py -all``,
reachable exclusively over ``docker exec``.

Two halves have to hold for the page to work, and each fails silently in a
different way, so both are pinned here.

**Script half.** ``enforce_all_covers()`` printed a total up front and then ran
the loop silently. The status poller derives the progress bar from the LAST
``n/n`` match in the log (``extract_progress``), so without a per-book line the
bar reads 0/0 for the entire run and then jumps to done — on a large library
that is indistinguishable from a hung job. It also printed no end marker, and
``is_cover_enforcer_finished()`` keys the kill thread's exit on exactly that
string, so the watcher thread would spin at 20Hz forever after a completed run.

The end marker is pinned as printed *unconditionally* after the summary
if/elif chain rather than inside a branch. ``enforce_all_covers`` returns
``(False, False, False)`` when the library holds no supported files, which takes
the first branch — marker inside the chain would mean an empty library hangs the
page and leaks the watcher thread.

**Flask half.** The routes and the blueprint registration are pinned
structurally. The routes actually serving is proven against a live container in
the PR, not here; what this file catches is the silent-drop case where the
blueprint is defined but never registered in ``main.py``, which yields a 404 on
a page whose nav button renders fine.
