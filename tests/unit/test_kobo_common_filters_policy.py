"""Pin the Kobo per-callsite ``common_filters`` policy decisions
(audit 2026-05-11, item B4).

Background: ``calibre_db.get_book_by_uuid`` bypasses ``common_filters``.
On the Kobo blueprint that means we can hand back books the user
shouldn't see (hidden, denied-tag, language-filtered, custom-column-
restricted) — which is wrong for some endpoints and right for others
because the Kobo is a device-trailing surface for already-synced books.

The audit decided per-callsite, documented in
``notes/KOBO-B4-COMMON-FILTERS-POLICY.md``:

| Line | Endpoint | Enforce filters? |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 469  | metadata GET | YES |
| 750  | shelf-add | YES |
| 822  | shelf-remove | NO |
| 949  | state GET/PUT | NO |
| 1244 | book DELETE | NO |

These tests pin both:

1. The helper ``get_book_by_uuid_for_kobo(book_uuid, *, enforce_policy)``
   exists, requires ``enforce_policy`` as a keyword arg, and applies
   ``common_filters(allow_show_archived=True)`` when ``enforce_policy=True``.
2. Each callsite in cps/kobo.py uses the helper with the policy-doc
   decision baked in.
