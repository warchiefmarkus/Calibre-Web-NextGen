"""Behavioural tests for ``scripts/set_ownership.sh`` (#874).

These drive the real bash, with ``chown`` replaced by a stub that records the
paths it was asked to walk, so each test asserts what the startup pass actually
does rather than what the source text looks like.

Two regressions are pinned here:

* **The duplicate walks the reporter measured.** dirs.json declares
  ``calibre_library_dir=/calibre-library`` and
  ``tmp_conversion_dir=/config/.cwa_conversion_tmp``, and the old inline block
  hardcoded ``/calibre-library`` *and* ``/config`` on top of that -- so a large
  library was chowned twice and a subtree of /config re-walked after /config's
  own recursive pass.

* **The floor.** The obvious "just build the list from dirs.json" fix drops
  ``/config`` and the app tree, both of which are load-bearing: ``/config``
  holds ``app.db`` and ``user_profiles.json``, which cwa-init writes *as root*
  after the early chown, and the app tree ships owned by the build-time uid 911
  that the base image usermods away from at runtime. dirs.json declares neither,
  and ``scripts/auto_library.py`` rewrites it in place at runtime, so a truncated
  file must not be able to silently reduce the pass to nothing.

A marker-based skip was considered and rejected on measurement: the app tree is
only expensive to walk on a *fresh* container (it arrives owned by the build-time
uid), and a marker kept in the image's writable layer is necessarily absent
exactly then -- so it would have skipped only the already-cheap restart case.
That cost is tracked separately; see the follow-up linked from #874.
