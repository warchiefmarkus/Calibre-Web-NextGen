"""Regression tests for fork #1231 — one source of truth for the installed
version, and one path for the Calibre version file.

Credit: @chloeroform (#1231) for the consolidation.

Three call sites each opened ``/app/CWA_RELEASE`` with their own copy of a
try/except: ``about.collect_stats``, ``admin.cwa_get_package_versions``, and
``constants.INSTALLED_VERSION``. Only the last one strips whitespace, falls
back on a zero-byte file, and honours the ``CWA_INSTALLED_VERSION`` env var
that cwa-init exports — so the admin table could disagree with ``USER_AGENT``
on the same running image. The two hand-rolled readers now defer to
``constants.INSTALLED_VERSION``.

That consolidation changes the value seen when the build never stamped a
version: the hand-rolled readers said ``"Unknown"``, the constant says
``v0.0.0``. ``"Unknown"`` does not parse as a release tag, so
``release_url_for_version`` returned ``None`` and the template rendered plain
text; ``v0.0.0`` *does* parse, so without the sentinel case below the admin
version table would link to ``/releases/tag/v0.0.0`` — a tag that was never
published. That is the regression these tests pin.

Separately, ``CALIBRE_RELEASE`` moved from ``/`` to ``/app`` to sit alongside
``CWA_RELEASE`` and ``KEPUBIFY_RELEASE`` — and was then **retired outright** in
#1274, because a build-time stamp cannot describe a binary that was replaced
afterwards. The cross-file tests at the bottom moved with it: they used to pin
that the writer and all three readers agreed on one path, and now pin that
nothing writes or reads the stamp at all, that the build ARG which selects the
download survives, and that both UIs share one runtime source.
