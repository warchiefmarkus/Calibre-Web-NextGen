"""The create/edit routes must resolve device ids the way ``data.json`` does.

``_data_json_row`` translates the internal ``origin_device_id`` /
``assigned_device_id`` integers to public ids through a ``device_public_ids``
map, and defaults that map to ``{}``. ``data.json`` passes it; the create and
edit routes originally did not, so a row that HAD been attributed answered
``origin_device_id: null`` on the very response the reader inserts
optimistically — the one highlight the user just watched itself be created
rendered as "Unknown device" until a refetch.

Caught by comparing the wire against the database rather than trusting either:
the POST response said ``null`` while the stored row said ``1``. The write
landed and the report said it did not.

Routed through a bare Flask app with ``current_user`` patched — the house
pattern (see ``test_cover_preview_endpoints.py``) — so this pins the route's
own serialisation without books, kepubs, or the login machinery.
