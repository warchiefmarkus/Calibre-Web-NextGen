"""Regression pins for fork issue #1089 — visible scrollbars in Firefox >= 153.

Background
----------
The SPA styled scrollbars exclusively through the legacy ``::-webkit-scrollbar``
pseudo-elements. Those were a WebKit/Blink extension that Firefox ignored, so
Firefox users got the platform's native scrollbars: on macOS and Android those
are *overlay* scrollbars, which fade out when idle and take no layout space.

Firefox 153 started honouring ``::-webkit-scrollbar``. Any browser that honours
it switches the affected scroller from an overlay scrollbar to a **classic**
one that is always visible while the content overflows and permanently steals
its width from the content box. Overnight, every Firefox user got persistent
scrollbars on the window, the sidebar and the Discover strip (#1089).

Measured in a **headed** Firefox 153 with overlay scrollbars enabled
(``ui.useOverlayScrollbars=1``, i.e. the reporter's configuration), against the
live SPA:

===========================================  ==========  =========
scroller                                     as shipped  with fix
===========================================  ==========  =========
sidebar ``nav``                                 15 px       0 px
Discover / MoreByAuthor ``.strip``              11 px       0 px
===========================================  ==========  =========

"Gutter" there is ``offsetWidth - clientWidth``: the width the scrollbar
permanently takes away from the content. An overlay scrollbar takes none.

The fix
-------
``scrollbar-width`` / ``scrollbar-color`` are the *standard* properties for
this. They express the same "slim, theme-coloured scrollbar" intent **without**
forcing a scroller off its native overlay behaviour. So the standard properties
become the single source of truth, and the legacy ``::-webkit-scrollbar`` block
is scoped to engines that lack them.

That is deliberately *not* a Firefox-specific carve-out. Keying off the feature
rather than the engine means the rule stays correct for whichever engine adopts
``::-webkit-scrollbar`` next, and old Chrome/Safari keep the styling they have
today.

The feature query must test **both** standard properties. They did not ship
together: Safari added ``scrollbar-width`` in 18.2 but ``scrollbar-color`` only
in 26.2. A guard on width alone would drop the legacy styling across that whole
Safari range while its replacement was only half-supported — the scrollbars
would be thin but fall back to the platform's default light colour on this dark
UI. Only an engine supporting the pair may take the standards-only path. This
is why :data:`SAFE_GUARD_RE` insists on the exact two-property form rather than
accepting anything that mentions ``scrollbar-width``.

Why a source pin rather than an e2e test
----------------------------------------
This regression only reproduces in a **headed** browser that is in overlay-
scrollbar mode. Headless Firefox reports a 0px gutter for the broken CSS as
well, so an e2e assertion in the SPA harness (headless, Chromium) would pass
against the bug and give a false green. The invariant below — "no ungated
``::-webkit-scrollbar`` rule ships in the SPA" — is what actually holds the
fix in place, and it runs everywhere.

Two traps for anyone re-verifying this by hand, both of which cost time here:

* A machine set to "always show scroll bars" (macOS System Settings, and the
  default on Windows) has no overlay scrollbars to lose, so the bug is
  invisible on it no matter which browser you use.
* **Headless** Firefox reports ``scrollbar-width: none`` as the *computed*
  value for an element that declares nothing at all. Read computed scrollbar
  properties in a headed browser or they will describe the harness rather than
  the page.

# Both UIs shipped the same bug. Measured in headed Firefox 153 with overlay

# cover both surfaces. Only shipping the SPA half would have made the changelog
# entry ("Firefox no longer draws a permanent scrollbar…") an over-claim for
# anyone on the classic theme.
#
# Two deliberate exclusions, so this list is a decision and not an oversight:
#
# * ``css/libs/`` — vendored third-party stylesheets (the SoundManager audio bar,
#   the PDF viewer). Not ours to restyle, and their scrollers are inside narrow
#   widgets rather than the page chrome.
# * ``kthoom.css`` — its ``.disabled-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar`` rule sets
#   ``display: none`` and is paired with ``scrollbar-width: none``. An engine
#   honouring it *hides* the scrollbar, which is the intent and is what the
#   standard property already did. There is no overlay-to-classic demotion to
#   undo, so guarding it would be noise.
