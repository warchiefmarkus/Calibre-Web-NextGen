"""Regression tests for fork issue #1167: the "Duplicates found" popup keeps
naming books that were deleted outside Calibre-Web, while a fresh scan and the
/duplicates page both correctly report none.

Root cause — a second, unguarded consumer of the same cache.

Fork #737 established that ``cwa_duplicate_cache`` is serialized at scan time,
so it does not reflect books the user has since ARCHIVED, HIDDEN, or that were
deleted from the library. The fix added ``filter_visible_duplicate_groups()``,
which mirrors what the /duplicates page does (drop any group with fewer than
two books still visible) and wired it into ``/duplicates/status``.

But ``/duplicates/status`` is not the only consumer. ``render_template.py``
builds a ``duplicate_notification`` dict on EVERY classic page render (injected
via ``layout.html``), reading the very same cache — and it never called the
re-validation. Its ``count`` was ``len()`` straight off the raw cache. So a
book deleted in Calibre desktop disappears from ``metadata.db`` (a scan and the
/duplicates page correctly find nothing) while the popup, rendered from the
stale cache, still insists on it. That is the reporter's symptom exactly, and
it explains the "can't reproduce exactly when": it depends on whether the cache
was last written before or after the external deletion.

A second drift bug in the same block: the dismissed-group filtering was
hand-rolled against ``group_hash``. ``filter_dismissed_groups()`` deliberately
matches on ``duplicate_key`` instead, because ``group_hash`` derives from the
display title/author of whichever book sorts first — so a metadata edit or new
ingest rotates it and dismissed groups silently resurface. The popup carried
that bug; the status endpoint did not.

Fix: both consumers now route through the same two shared helpers, via
``_build_duplicate_notification()``. Single source of truth, no drift.

These tests pin the drop/trim behaviour against a controlled visibility oracle
(so the reporter's case — a pair with one book deleted — is proven to leave the
popup), pin that dismissals match on the stable key, and source-pin that the
render path actually wires the re-validation in.
