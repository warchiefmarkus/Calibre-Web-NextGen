"""The "Recent" library order: what this user has been reading, then the rest.

The operator's request was one sentence — "recently read first, then the books
you haven't read, newest added". The work is in *recently read*, because this
build records reading activity in several places and only some of them mean a
human opened the book.

Reading activity, enumerated from the write paths:

* ``ub.ReadBook.last_modified`` / ``.last_time_started_reading`` — written by
  ``kosync.update_book_read_status`` (KOReader sync AND the web reader, which
  reuses it), by ``kobo.HandleStateRequest``'s StatusInfo branch, and by
  ``helper.edit_book_read_status`` (the Read checkmark).
* ``ub.KoboBookmark.progress_percent`` / ``.last_modified`` / ``.created_at`` —
  the cross-device position carrier, advanced by
  ``device_reading_position.advance_kobo_bookmark`` from a Kobo state PUT, a
  KOReader sync and a web-reader save alike.
* ``ub.Bookmark.updated_at`` — the web reader's own epub.js position, stamped
  by ``cps/api/reader.py::save_bookmark`` on every save (including a save that
  carries no percentage, or one whose percentage loses furthest-wins).

The trap these tests exist for: a *row* is not evidence of reading.
``kobo.HandleStateRequest`` calls ``get_or_create_reading_state`` on **GET** as
well as PUT, so merely listing a book on a Kobo inserts ReadBook +
KoboReadingState + KoboBookmark + KoboStatistics rows with fresh clocks. An
order keyed on row existence, or on ``KoboReadingState.last_modified``, sorts a
library by "what my Kobo asked about" instead of "what I read". Every timestamp
below is therefore gated on positive evidence — a non-unread status, or a
positive stored progress — and ``test_a_kobo_state_fetch_alone_...`` is the
test that fails if that gate is dropped.

KOSync's own ``kosync_progress`` table is deliberately NOT a fourth source: it
is keyed by file checksum in app.db while the checksums live in metadata.db,
and its PUT handler already mirrors every matched book into ReadBook and the
Kobo bookmark (``kosync.py``, "Update user's ReadBook status if we matched a
book"). ``test_koreader_sync_...`` drives that mirror.

Everything here runs against real SQL on one connection carrying both schemas —
the same ATTACH shape ``cps/db.py::setup_db`` builds in production — because
the requirement is that recency is computed *in the query*, under LIMIT, and a
mock of the session cannot show that.
