"""Regression tests for fork issue #627 — "Send to Reader" never registered a
KOReader sync fingerprint, so progress from an emailed book went nowhere.

The reporter's whole workflow is emailing books to a PocketBook. KOReader
identifies a book by hashing the file it holds and asks the server about that
hash; the server had never seen the emailed file, so the position was stored
orphaned and never surfaced in the library. Their logs showed it plainly:
`No book found for checksum: 2069bab8…`. Books pulled over OPDS synced fine,
because the download path *does* register the exact file it serves.

Two things had to be true and neither was:

1. The CONTENT digest must cover the bytes actually attached. With metadata
   embedding on, the email carries a freshly-staged export whose bytes differ
   from the library file — hashing the library file would still not match what
   the device holds.
2. The FILENAME digest must cover the name the RECIPIENT sees, i.e. the MIME
   attachment name — not the basename of our temp export, which is a name no
   device will ever know about. This matters because the reporter was told to
   put the kosync plugin in "filename" matching mode.

Seam: the real hashing runs; only `store_checksum` (the DB write) is captured.
So these assert the digests that would actually be persisted, computed from a
real file on disk — not that "some call happened".

RED on main: test_content_digest_covers_the_emailed_bytes,
test_filename_digest_uses_the_attachment_name_not_the_temp_export,
test_raw_library_file_is_registered_when_metadata_embedding_is_off.
Green already (guards against regression): the returned-bytes tests, the
sync-disabled test, and the never-breaks-the-email test.
