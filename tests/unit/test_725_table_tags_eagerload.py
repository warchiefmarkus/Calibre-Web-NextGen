"""Regression guard for fork issue #725 — the Tags column on the new-UI table
view (#725 / PR #756).

The table view serializes ``book.tags`` for every book on a page via the shared
``/api/v1/books`` list path (``cps.api.serializers.serialize_book_list_item``),
which reads from ``calibre_db.fill_indexpage_with_archived_books``. That list
path must **eager-load** ``Books.tags`` in the same query it loads the books in,
so the page does not pay a follow-up ``SELECT … FROM tags`` per poll.

Why this matters here specifically: ``Books.tags`` is configured
``lazy='selectin'`` (``cps/db.py``), so the list query's eager-load options block
must include ``joinedload(Books.tags)``. The detail path
(``get_filtered_book``) already eager-loads tags; PR #756 originally claimed the
list path did too — it did not, so the list page issued an extra ``selectin``
query every page.

These two tests pin the fix from two angles:

* ``test_fill_indexpage_options_block_eager_loads_books_tags`` — a source pin on
  the real ``fill_indexpage_with_archived_books``: it MUST apply
  ``joinedload(Books.tags)`` in BOTH eager-load options blocks (the main list
  query block AND the random-books block). Removing either line turns this red.
  (``inspect.getsource`` source-pin for a refactor-fragile invariant, per the
  project's no-slop bar — the eager-load directive is exactly the property under
  test, not a field-name triviality.)
* ``test_list_query_eager_loads_tags_no_follow_up_selectin`` — behavioural:
  drives the REAL ``fill_indexpage_with_archived_books`` against an in-memory
  calibre metadata DB (real ``Books``/``Tags``/``Authors`` models) and counts SQL
  statements. With the eager load the page resolves in the eager-join baseline
  (6 statements: total_count + the main eager join + the model's other selectin
  relationship loads). Removing ``joinedload(Books.tags)`` makes the ``selectin``
  strategy fire a follow-up ``SELECT`` for tags → the count rises to 7 → this
  assertion fails. The baseline is stable across page sizes (the statements are
  per-relationship, not per-book).
