"""Regression tests for fork issue #948: the New UI separated authors with a
comma, so a multi-author list was unreadable.

An author's *display name* may itself contain a comma — "Leckie, Ann" is an
ordinary Calibre author name — so a comma cannot also separate one author from
the next: "Leckie, Ann, Tchaikovsky, Adrian" reads as four people.

' & ' is not a new convention. Calibre joins authors with '&'; the classic
templates render '&' between author links; ``cps/api/edit.py`` hands the edit
form '&'-joined authors and the SPA field label says "Authors (separate with
&)". Only the SPA's *display* path had drifted to ', '.

The pins:

* the shared constant exists and is ' & ' (the SPA had eight independent ', '
  literals — that duplication is what let display drift from every other
  surface, so the fix collapses them to one source of truth);
* no SPA file joins authors with ', ' again (exhaustiveness — a *new* author
  list added with the old separator fails here rather than reaching a user);
* the backend and the SPA agree byte-for-byte, so the two halves cannot drift
  apart silently;
* comma-lists whose values cannot contain commas (tags, languages, publishers,
  formats) are deliberately NOT swept up — authors are the exception.

Every pin fails on pre-fix code and passes on the branch.
