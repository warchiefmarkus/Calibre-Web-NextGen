"""Regression coverage for fork #1331 — "Newest" did not put the newest book first.

@jdaybell reported that the new UI's library sort "seems to correctly sort and
then suddenly it doesn't anymore", and that it happens after switching sort.

The cause is an ORDER BY that ties. Every book list in this app pages with
LIMIT/OFFSET, and the sort orders for ``new``/``old``/``pubnew``/``pubold``/
``modifiednew``/``modifiedold``/``seriesasc``/``seriesdesc`` named exactly one
non-unique column. SQLite is then free to return the tied rows in whatever
order its plan happens to produce — measured below: a bulk ingest that gives
twenty books one timestamp comes back *oldest-first* under "Newest", because
the planner walks the rowid; add an index on the sort column and the same query
returns the opposite order.

``abc``/``zyx`` already ended in ``Books.id`` and were unaffected, which is why
switching between sorts is what exposes it.

These tests pin the fix at the level it has to hold at: every order in the one
shared map ends in a unique tiebreaker, both UIs read that same map, and the
resulting page sequence is invariant to the query plan.
