"""Fork #1094: a book whose conversion failed vanished from the library.

Reported by @auspex against v4.1.20: a 63MB PDF was picked up, spent 45
minutes in ``ebook-convert``, got killed by the service safety timeout, and
then simply was not there. The library had no entry for it and the ingest
folder no longer held the file.

The cause was structural, not timeout-specific. ``main()`` imported the book
only inside ``if convert_successful:`` and had no ``else``, so *every*
conversion failure — timeout, unsupported internals, a corrupt source, a
missing plugin — returned without ever calling ``add_book_to_library()``,
while the ``finally`` block deleted the source from the ingest folder. The
two sibling branches that decline to convert (format in the ignore list,
auto-convert switched off) both import the original already, so the fallback
makes the behaviour consistent rather than introducing a new rule.

Pinned behaviour:
  1. A failed ``convert_book()`` still imports the ORIGINAL file.
  2. A failed ``convert_to_kepub()`` does the same.
  3. A SUCCESSFUL conversion still imports the CONVERTED file and not the
     original (anti-vacuity — a fallback that always fires would pass 1 and 2
     while breaking the normal path).
  4. ``backup()`` names the absolute destination directory it wrote to, so
     "moved to failed backup" is actionable instead of a dead end.
  5. The ingest service no longer claims the processor "should have timed out
     internally", because it previously had no conversion timeout at all —
     ``ingest_timeout_minutes`` bounded only the file-stability wait.
  6. The processor now owns a conversion deadline just inside the service's
     hard ``timeout``, derived from it in one place. Without that, the
     reporter's own case never reached the fallback at all: the supervisor
     SIGTERMed the processor mid-conversion, so ``main()`` never regained
     control. An overrun is now an ordinary failure, and the book is imported.
  7. Every non-success path of ``convert_to_kepub()`` returns a ``(bool, str)``
     pair. One returned ``None``, which made ``main()``'s tuple-unpack raise
     ``TypeError`` and skip the fallback — dropping the book for exactly the
     reason this issue is about.
  8. A failed kepub conversion backs up the original as well as any
     intermediate epub, so the failed folder holds the file the user dropped.
  9. The conversion deadline is ONE shared budget across both stages, not a
     fresh timeout per subprocess. A kepub ingest of a non-EPUB converts twice
     inside one hard timeout; two full deadlines could add up to more than the
     watchdog allowed, leaving the second conversion running when SIGTERM
     arrived — re-opening this very bug at the DEFAULT timeout setting.
 10. The deadline is monotonic in the hard timeout. A flat 30s reserve applied
     to a small timeout inverted the two (a 31s timeout left 1s to convert
     while a 30s timeout left 23s); the reserve is now capped so conversion
     always keeps the majority of the budget.

Findings 9 and 10, plus the OverflowError on a non-finite env value, came from
the cross-family review of PR #1157. The converter-child cleanup finding from
the same review is tracked separately in #1161.
