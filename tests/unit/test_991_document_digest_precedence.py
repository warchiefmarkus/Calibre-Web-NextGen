"""Regression coverage for #991 — "Book status stopped synching / not recognised".

The server resolves a KOReader sync by matching the digest the device sends
against `book_format_checksums`, which only ever holds digests of bytes the
server actually served (`cps/progress_syncing/checksums/koreader.py`).

The plugin used to answer that question from KOReader's per-document sidebar
cache (`partial_md5_checksum`) and only hash the file when the cache was empty.
The sidecar is keyed by file PATH, so it survives the file at that path being
replaced. Once the server's copy of a book changed and the reader re-downloaded
over the old file, the device kept reporting the digest of bytes it no longer
held — and every re-download registered one more digest the device would never
compute. The reporter re-downloaded over OPDS repeatedly and kept getting
`No book found for checksum`, which is exactly this shape.

The fix inverts the precedence: the bytes on disk are the authority and the
cache is a fallback for when hashing is impossible.

**These tests are structural tripwires, not behavioural coverage.** They only
read `main.lua` as text; they never execute it. The behaviour is proven by two
Lua suites that do execute the code, and CI runs no Lua runner, so what these
buy is a CI-visible alarm when the shipped wiring drifts away from the shape the
Lua suites assume:

* `koreader/plugins/cwasync.koplugin/tests/sync_logic_test.lua` — the pure
  precedence policy.
* `koreader/plugins/cwasync.koplugin/tests/document_digest_test.lua` — the real
  `getDocumentDigest` source, sliced out of `main.lua` and loaded into a sandbox
  with stubbed `util` / `io` / `DocSettings` / `self.ui`. That one is verified
  red against the pre-fix `main.lua`.

Read the assertions here accordingly: passing means the source still *looks*
like the version the Lua suites exercised, not that it *behaves*.
