"""Regression tests for the blueprint-level cross-site guard (cps.api._reject_cross_site_mutation) — #1370.

The CSRF *token* was already enforced on /api/v1, but a request carrying a valid
token together with `Origin: https://evil.example` was accepted and performed the
write. Flask-WTF's own referer check is off here (`WTF_CSRF_SSL_STRICT=False` in
cps/__init__.py), so nothing looked at where the request claimed to come from.

The guard is deliberately "verify if present": a browser cannot suppress `Origin`
on a cross-site mutation, so checking it only when stated closes the browser CSRF
vector without breaking curl/native clients that send no such header (and which
carry no ambient credentials to be CSRF'd in the first place).
