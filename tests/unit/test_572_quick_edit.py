"""Fork #572 — the new UI lacked quick-edit affordances the old one had.

Two focused v1 additions, source-pinned here so they can't be silently removed:

1. A "drop into edit" pencil on book cards (catalog + search results) that jumps
   straight to the edit page without opening the book first.
2. Inline add/remove tags on the book detail page, so you can tweak a book's tags
   without opening the full editor and hand-editing a comma-separated string.

Behavioural coverage is the live Playwright pass; these guard the wiring.
