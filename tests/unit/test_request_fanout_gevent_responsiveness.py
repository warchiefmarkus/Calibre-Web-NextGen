"""The request-path provider fan-outs must not stall the gevent hub.

Fork issue #954: clicking "Change cover" made the whole app unreachable
until the candidate search finished. ``cps/server.py`` runs gevent WITHOUT
``monkey.patch_all()``, so every greenlet shares one OS thread. A stdlib
``concurrent.futures`` wait (``as_completed``/``Future.result``/the
``Executor`` context-manager exit) parks that thread on a
``threading.Condition``, which the gevent hub cannot preempt — so EVERY
other in-flight HTTP request is frozen for the whole fan-out.

These tests measure the invariant the user actually cares about: while a
fan-out runs, other greenlets (= other people's requests) keep getting
scheduled.
