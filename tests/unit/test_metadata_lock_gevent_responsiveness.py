"""Waiting for the metadata.db write lock must not stall the gevent hub.

``cps/server.py`` runs gevent WITHOUT ``monkey.patch_all()``, so every
request is a greenlet and all of them share one OS thread. #954 covered
blocking *work* on that thread (provider fan-outs), and
``cps/services/parallel.py`` fixed it. This file covers the other door into
the same failure: blocking *waiting*.

``metadata_db_write_lock`` polls a POSIX flock and sleeps between attempts.
The poll loop has no other yield point, so a stdlib sleep there does not cost
one poll interval — it costs the whole wait, because the hub never runs again
until the lock is won. The other writer is the ingest processor holding the
lock across a ``calibredb add``, and the timeout is 120s, so on the pre-fix
code one metadata write during an ingest froze the entire app.

That is a user-visible outage on a common pairing (edit a book, rename or
merge a tag, upload — while a book is being ingested), and it also shows up in
CI as ``socket hang up`` when the e2e projects write concurrently.

The test measures the invariant the user cares about: while one greenlet waits
for the lock, other greenlets (= other people's requests) still get scheduled.
